      "{'AlbertAmmons': 'Albert Clifton Ammons (March 1, 1907 – December 3, 1949)[1] was an American pianist and player of boogie-woogie, a bluesy jazz style popular from the late 1930s to the mid-1940s.[2]Ammons was born in Chicago, Illinois. His parents were pianists, and he had learned to play by the age of ten. His interest in boogie-woogie is attributed to his close friendship with Meade Lux Lewis and also his father\\'s interest in the style. Both Albert and Meade would practice together on the piano in the Ammons household. From the age of ten, Ammons learned about chords by marking the depressed keys on the family pianola (player piano) with a pencil and repeated the process until he had mastered it.[3] He also played percussion in a drum and bugle corps as a teenager and was soon performing with bands in clubs in Chicago. After World War I he became interested in the blues, learning by listening to the Chicago pianists Hersal Thomas and the brothers Alonzo and Jimmy Yancey.[4]In the early to mid-1920s Ammons worked as a cab driver for the Silver Taxicab Company. In 1924 he met up with his boyhood friend Meade Lux Lewis, who was also then a taxi driver. Soon the two players began working as a team, performing at club parties. Ammons started his own band at the Club DeLisa in 1934 and remained at the club for the next two years.[5] During that time he played with a five-piece band that included Guy Kelly, Dalbert Bright, Jimmy Hoskins, and Israel Crosby. Ammons also recorded as Albert Ammons\\'s Rhythm Kings for Decca Records in 1936. The Rhythm Kings\\' version of \"Swanee River Boogie\" sold a million copies, and their 1936 recording of \"Boogie Woogie Stomp\" has been described as \"the first 12-bar piano based boogie-woogie, [which] was imitated by many jazz bands.\"[1]Ammons moved from Chicago to New York City, where he teamed up with another pianist, Pete Johnson.[5] The two performed regularly at the Café Society,[5] occasionally joined by Lewis or by other jazz musicians, including Benny Goodman and Harry James.On December 23, 1938, Ammons appeared at Carnegie Hall with Johnson and Lewis in From Spirituals to Swing, a concert produced by John H. Hammond, which helped launch the boogie-woogie craze.[5] Two weeks later, the record producer Alfred Lion, who had attended the concert, started Blue Note Records, recording nine Ammons solos, including \"The Blues\" and \"Boogie Woogie Stomp\", eight by Lewis and two duets in a one-day session in a rented recording studio.[6]In 1941, Ammons\\'s boogie-woogie music was accompanied by drawn-on-film animation in the short film Boogie-Doodle, by Norman McLaren.[7] Ammons played himself in the movie Boogie-Woogie Dream (1944), with Lena Horne and Johnson.[8] As a sideman with Sippie Wallace in the 1940s Ammons recorded a session with his son, the tenor saxophonist Gene Ammons.[5] Although the boogie-woogie fad began to die down in 1945, Ammons had no difficulty securing work. He continued to tour as a solo artist, and between 1946 and 1949 recorded his last sides, for Mercury Records, with the bassist Israel Crosby, and took on the position of staff pianist with the Lionel Hampton Orchestra. In 1949 he played at the inauguration of President Harry S. Truman.[9]During his last years, Ammons played mainly at the Beehive Club and the Tailspin Club in Chicago. Four days before he died, he had been at the Yancey apartment listening to Don Ewell and Jimmy Yancey play. Ammons could play only one song, having just regained the use of his hands after a temporary paralysis.[10][11]Ammons died of natural causes on December 3, 1949, in Chicago, three months before his 43rd birthday.[1] He was interred at the Lincoln Cemetery, at Kedzie Avenue in Blue Island, Worth Township, Cook County, Illinois.Ammons has had wide influence on countless pianists, such as Jerry Lee Lewis, Dave Alexander, Dr. John, Hadda Brooks, Johnnie Johnson, Ray Bryant, Erroll Garner, Katie Webster, Axel Zwingenberger, Henri Herbert, and the German pianist, Jörg Hegemann. The latter honoured Ammons, on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of Ammons\\' birth, with his album, A Tribute to Albert Ammons.', 'AndrewsSisters': 'The Andrews Sisters were an American close harmony singing group of the swing and boogie-woogie eras. The group consisted of three sisters: contralto LaVerne Sophia (July 6, 1911 – May 8, 1967), soprano Maxene Angelyn (January 3, 1916 – October 21, 1995), and mezzo-soprano Patricia Marie \"Patty\" (February 16, 1918 – January 30, 2013).[1] Throughout their long career, the sisters sold well over 75 million records (the last official count released by MCA Records in the mid-1970s). Their 1941 hit \"Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy\" can be considered an early example of rhythm and blues[2][3] or jump blues.The Andrews Sisters\\' harmonies and songs are still influential today, and have been covered by entertainers such as Bette Midler, Christina Aguilera, Pentatonix, and others. The group was inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 1998.[4] Writing for Bloomberg, Mark Schoifet said the sisters became the most popular female vocal group of the first half of the 20th century. They are still widely acclaimed today for their famous close harmonies.The sisters were born to Peter Andreos (anglicized to \"Andrews\" upon arriving in the US) and Olga (née Sollie); their father was Greek and their mother Norwegian-American of the Lutheran faith. Patty, the youngest and the lead singer of the group, was 7 when the group was formed, and 12 when they won first prize at a talent contest at the local Orpheum Theatre in Minneapolis, where LaVerne played piano accompaniment for the silent film showings in exchange for free dancing lessons for herself and her sisters. Following the collapse of their father\\'s Minneapolis restaurant, the sisters went on the road to support the family.[5]They started their career as imitators of an earlier successful singing group, the Boswell Sisters who were popular in the 1930s. After singing with various dance bands and touring in vaudeville with the likes of Leon Belasco (and his orchestra),[6] and comic bandleader Larry Rich, they first came to national attention with their recordings and radio broadcasts in 1937, most notably via their major Decca record hit, \"Bei Mir Bist Du Schön\" (translation: \"To Me, You Are Beautiful\"),[7] originally a Yiddish tune, the lyrics of which Sammy Cahn had translated to English and \"which the girls harmonized to perfection.\"[8] They followed this success with a string of best-selling records over the next two years and they became a household name by the 1940s.[9]Instrumental to the sisters\\' success over the years were their parents, Olga and Peter, their orchestra leader and musical arranger, Vic Schoen (1916–2000), and Jack and David Kapp, who founded Decca Records.During World War II they entertained the Allied forces extensively in America, Africa and Italy, visiting Army, Navy, Marine and Coast Guard bases, war zones, hospitals, and munitions factories.[10] They encouraged U.S. citizens to purchase war bonds with their rendition of Irving Berlin\\'s song \"Any Bonds Today?\". They also helped actress Bette Davis and actor John Garfield found California\\'s famous Hollywood Canteen, a welcome retreat for servicemen where the trio often performed, volunteering their personal time to sing and dance for the soldiers, sailors and marines (they did the same at New York City\\'s Stage Door Canteen during the war). While touring, they often treated three random servicemen to dinner when they were dining out. They recorded a series of Victory Discs (V-Discs) for distribution to Allied fighting forces only, again volunteering their time for studio sessions for the Music Branch, Special Service Division of the Army Service Forces, and they were dubbed the \"Sweethearts of the Armed Forces Radio Service\" for their many appearances on shows such as \"Command Performance\", \"Mail Call\", and \"G.I. Journal.\"[11]An ad in the 1951 Radio Annual showed photos of the Andrews as children, as contemporary singers, and as old women in the then-future year of 1975; the act would not make it that long.[12] In the 1950s, Patty Andrews decided to break away from the act to be a soloist.[13] She had married the trio\\'s pianist, Walter Weschler, who became the group\\'s manager and demanded more money for Patty.[1] When Maxene and LaVerne learned of Patty\\'s decision from newspaper gossip columns rather than from their own sister, it caused a bitter two-year separation, especially when Patty sued LaVerne for a larger share of their parents\\' estate.[14] Patty attributed the breakup to the deaths of their parents: \"We had been together nearly all our lives,\" Patty explained in 1971. \"Then in one year our dream world ended. Our mother died (in 1948) and then our father (in 1949). All three of us were upset, and we were at each other\\'s throats all the time.\"[1] In 1951, they recorded The Windmill Song which is an adaptation of the French song Maître Pierre written in 1948 by Henri Betti (music) and Jacques Plante (lyrics). The English lyrics were written by Mitchell Parish. The Andrews Sisters formally broke up in 1953.[13]Maxene and LaVerne tried to continue the act as a duo and met with good press during a 10-day tour of Australia, but a reported suicide attempt by Maxene in December 1954[15] put a halt to any further tours (Maxene spent a short time in the hospital after swallowing 18 sleeping pills, an occurrence that LaVerne told reporters was an accident). Maxene and LaVerne did appear together on The Red Skelton Show on October 26, 1954 singing the humorous \"Why Do They Give The Solos To Patty\" as well as lip-synching \"Beer Barrel Polka\" with Skelton in drag filling in for Patty. This however did not sit well with Patty and a cease and desist order was sent to Skelton. The sisters\\' private relationship was often troubled and Patty blamed it on Maxene: \"Ever since I was born, Maxene has been a problem,\" she said.[16]The trio reunited in 1956 and signed a new recording deal with Capitol Records, for whom Patty was already a featured soloist. By this point however, rock-and-roll and doo-wop were dominating the charts and older artists were left by the wayside. The sisters recorded a dozen singles through 1959, some of which attempted to keep up with the times by incorporating rock sounds. None of these achieved any major success. In addition, they produced three hi-fi albums, including a vibrant LP of songs from the dancing 1920s with Billy May\\'s orchestra. In 1962, they signed with Dot Records and recorded a series of stereo albums until 1964, both re-recordings of earlier hits which incorporated up-to-date production techniques, as well as new material, including \"I Left My Heart In San Francisco\", \"Still\", \"The End of the World\", \"Puff the Magic Dragon\", \"Sailor\", \"Satin Doll\", \"Mr. Bass Man\", the theme from Come September, and the theme from A Man and a Woman. They toured extensively during the 1960s, favoring top nightclubs in Las Vegas, Nevada, California, and London, England.[17]Eldest sister LaVerne died in 1967 at the age of 55 after a year-long bout with cancer[18] during which she was replaced by singer Joyce DeYoung. DeYoung fulfilled concert appearances including an appearance on The Dean Martin Show on November 30, 1967, but she did not record with Patty and Maxene. LaVerne had founded the original group, and often acted as the peacemaker among the three during the sisters\\' lives, more often siding with her parents, to whom the girls were extremely devoted, than with either of her sisters. Their last appearance together as a trio was on The Dean Martin Show on September 29, 1966.After LaVerne died, Maxene and Patty continued to perform periodically until 1968, when Maxene decided she would become the Dean of Women at Tahoe Paradise College,[19] teaching acting, drama and speech at a Lake Tahoe college and working with troubled teens, and Patty was once again eager to be a soloist.[20]In 1969, Patty appeared in Lucille Ball\\'s third series Here\\'s Lucy, in the sixth episode of the second season, titled \"Lucy and the Andrews Sisters\". The episode has Patty enlisting the help of Lucy, her daughter Kim (played by Lucie Arnaz), and her son Craig (Desi Arnaz Jr.) to perform a medley of Andrews Sisters hits for the Andrews Sisters Fan Club reunion. Lucy played LaVerne, Kim (Lucie Arnaz) played Maxene, and Craig (Desi Arnaz, Jr.) played Bing Crosby. She also had a cameo as herself along with many other stars in the 1970 film The Phynx.Patty and Maxene\\'s careers experienced a resurgence when Bette Midler covered \"Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy\" in 1973. The next year, the pair debuted on Broadway in the Sherman Brothers\\' nostalgic World War II musical: Over Here! which premiered at the Shubert Theatre to rave reviews. This was a follow-up to Patty\\'s success in Victory Canteen, a 1971 California revue. Over Here! starred Maxene and Patty (with Janie Sell filling in for LaVerne and winning a Tony Award for her performance) and was written with both sisters in mind for the leads. It launched the careers of many now notable theater, film, and television stars, including John Travolta, Marilu Henner, Treat Williams and Ann Reinking. It was the last major hurrah for the sisters and was cut short owing to a conflict with the show\\'s producers initiated by Patty\\'s husband including a lawsuit he filed against the show\\'s composers, the Sherman Brothers, quashing an extensively scheduled road tour.[21] Over Here! lasted only a year, and its end marked the last time the sisters would ever sing together.[22]Patty continually distanced herself from Maxene, until her death, and would not explain her motives regarding the separation. People close to both sisters, including family members, believed that Patty\\'s husband, Wally Weschler, was to blame. Maxene appealed to Patty for a reunion, personally if not professionally, both in public and in private, but to no avail. Maxene suffered a serious heart attack while performing in Illinois in 1982 and underwent quadruple bypass surgery, from which she successfully recovered. Patty visited her sister while she was hospitalized. Now sometimes appearing as \"Patti\" (but still signing autographs as \"Patty\") she re-emerged in the late 1970s as a regular panelist on The Gong Show. Maxene had a very successful comeback as a cabaret soloist in 1979 and toured worldwide for the next 15 years, recording a solo album in 1985 entitled \"Maxene: An Andrews Sister\" for Bainbridge Records. Patty started her own solo act in 1980, but did not receive the critical acclaim her sister had for her performances, even though Patty was considered to be the \"star\" of the group for years. The critics\\' major complaint was that Patty\\'s show concentrated too much on Andrews Sisters material, which did not allow Patty\\'s own talents as an expressive and bluesy vocalist to shine through.[23]The two sisters did reunite, albeit briefly, on October 1, 1987, when they received a star on Hollywood\\'s Walk of Fame, even singing a few bars of \"Beer Barrel Polka\" for the Entertainment Tonight cameras. An earthquake shook the area that very morning and the ceremony was nearly cancelled, which caused Patty to joke, \"Some people said that earthquake this morning was LaVerne because she couldn\\'t be here, but really it was just Maxene and me on the telephone.\" Besides this, and a few brief private encounters, they remained somewhat estranged for the last few years.[24]Shortly after her Off-Broadway debut in New York City in a show called Swingtime Canteen, Maxene suffered another heart attack and died at Cape Cod Hospital on October 21, 1995, making Patty the last surviving Andrews Sister. Not long before she died, Maxene told music historian William Ruhlmann, \"I have nothing to regret. We got on the carousel and we each got the ring and I was satisfied with that. There\\'s nothing I would do to change things if I could...Yes, I would. I wish I had the ability and the power to bridge the gap between my relationship with my sister, Patty.\"[25] Upon hearing the news of her sister\\'s death, Patty became very distraught. Several days later, Patty\\'s husband Wally fell down a flight of stairs and broke both wrists. Patty did not attend her sister\\'s memorial services in New York City, nor in California.[citation needed] Said Bob Hope of Maxene\\'s passing, \"She was more than part of The Andrews Sisters, much more than a singer. She was a warm and wonderful lady who shared her talent and wisdom with others.\"[25]LaVerne Andrews married Lou Rogers,[18] a trumpet player in Vic Schoen\\'s band, in 1948. The two remained together until LaVerne\\'s death from cancer on May 8, 1967 (Vic died in 1995).[26] The ashes of LaVerne and Maxene Andrews are interred in the Columbarium of Memory of the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California,[27] close to the ashes of their parents.Maxene Andrews married music publisher Lou Levy in 1941. They separated in 1949. Levy was the sisters\\' manager from 1937 to 1951. She died on October 21, 1995, from a heart attack while on Cape Cod.[28]Patty Andrews married agent Marty Melcher in 1947 and left him in 1949, when he pursued a romantic relationship with Doris Day. She then married Walter Wechsler, the trio\\'s pianist, in 1951. Patty died of natural causes at her home in Northridge, California, on January 30, 2013 at the age of 94. Wechsler, her husband of nearly 60 years, had died on August 28, 2010, at the age of 88.[5][29] She is survived by her foster daughter Pam DuBois .[1]Joyce DeYoung Murray (born May 24, 1926), who briefly replaced LaVerne in the late 60\\'s, died on March 6, 2014 at the age of 87.[30]The Andrews Sisters were the most imitated of all female singing groups and influenced many artists, including Mel Tormé, Les Paul and Mary Ford, The Four Freshmen, The McGuire Sisters, The Manhattan Dolls, The Lennon Sisters, The Pointer Sisters, The Manhattan Transfer, Barry Manilow and Bette Midler. Elvis Presley was a fan. The imitation occurred internationally, for instance The Harmony Sisters, a popular group that performed from the 1930s to the 1950s in Finland was one such singing group.[31]Most of the Andrews Sisters\\' music has been restored and released in compact disc form. Over 300 of their original Decca recordings, a good portion of which was hit material, has yet to be released by MCA/Decca in over 50 years. Many of these Decca recordings have been used in such television shows and Hollywood movies as Homefront, ER, Agent Carter, The Brink\\'s Job, National Lampoon\\'s Christmas Vacation, Swing Shift, Raggedy Man, Summer of \\'42, Slaughterhouse-Five, Maria\\'s Lovers, Harlem Nights, In Dreams, Murder in the First, L.A. Confidential, American Horror Story, Just Shoot Me, Gilmore Girls, Mama\\'s Family, War and Remembrance, Jakob the Liar, Lolita, The Polar Express, The Chronicles of Narnia, Molly: An American Girl on the Home Front, Memoirs of a Geisha, and Bon Voyage, Charlie Brown (and Don\\'t Come Back!!). Comical references to the trio in television sitcoms can be found as early as I Love Lucy and as recently as Everybody Loves Raymond. In 2007, their version of \"Bei Mir Bist Du Schön\" was included in the game BioShock, a first-person shooter that takes place in an alternate history 1960, and later in 2008, their song \"Civilization\" (with Danny Kaye) was included in the Atomic Age-inspired video game Fallout 3. The 2010 video game Mafia II features numerous Andrews Sisters songs, with \"Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy\", \"Strip Polka\" and \"Rum And Coca-Cola\". The 2011 video game L.A. Noire features the song \"Pistol Packin\\' Mama\", where the sisters perform a duet with Bing Crosby.[32] The sisters were again featured in a Fallout game in 2015, when their songs \"Pistol Packin\\' Mama\" and \"Civilization\" were featured in the game Fallout 4.Christina Aguilera used the Andrews Sisters\\' \"Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy\" to inspire her song \"Candyman\" (released as a single in 2007) from her hit album Back to Basics. The song was co-written by Linda Perry. The London-based trio the Puppini Sisters uses their style harmonies on several Andrews Sisters and other hits of the 1940s and 1950s as well as later rock and disco hits. The trio has said their name is a tribute to The Andrews Sisters. The National WW2 Museum\\'s Victory Belles are proud to pay tribute to the Andrews Sisters performing their music daily in the Stage Door Canteen in New Orleans. The Manhattan Dolls, a New York City-based touring group, performs both the popular tunes sung by the Andrews Sisters and some of the more obscure tunes such as \"Well Alright\" and \"South American Way\" as well.[33][34]In 2008 and 2009, the BBC produced The Andrews Sisters: Queens of the Music Machines, a one-hour documentary on the history of the Andrews Sisters from their upbringing to the present. The American premier of the show was June 21, 2009, in their birthplace of Mound, Minnesota. In 2008, Mound dedicated \"The Andrews Sisters Trail\". The sisters spent summers in Mound[1] with their uncles Pete and Ed Solie, who had a grocery store there. Maxene Andrews always said that the summers in Mound created a major sense of \"normalcy\" and \"a wonderful childhood\" in a life that otherwise centered on the sisters\\' careers. The Westonka Historical Society has a large collection of Andrews Sisters memorabilia.[35]When the sisters burst upon the music scene in the late 1930s, they shook a very solid musical foundation, producing a slick harmonic blend by singing at the top of their lungs while trying—successfully—to emulate the blare of three harmonizing trumpets,[36] with a full big band racing behind them. Some bandleaders of the day, such as Artie Shaw, along with his musicians, resented them for taking the focus away from the band and emphasizing the vocals instead. They were in as high demand as the big bandleaders themselves, many of whom did not want to share the spotlight and play backup to a girl trio.[citation needed]Nevertheless, they found instant appeal with teenagers and young adults who were engrossed in the swing and jazz idioms, especially when they performed with nearly all of the major big bands, including those led by Glenn Miller, Benny Goodman, Buddy Rich, Tommy Dorsey, Jimmy Dorsey, Gene Krupa, Joe Venuti, Freddie Slack, Eddie Heywood, Bob Crosby (Bing\\'s brother), Desi Arnaz, Guy Lombardo, Les Brown, Bunny Berigan, Xavier Cugat, Paul Whiteman, Ted Lewis, Nelson Riddle and mood-master Gordon Jenkins, whose orchestra and chorus accompanied them on such successful soft and melancholy renditions as \"I Can Dream, Can\\'t I?\" (which shot to number one on Billboard and remained in the Top 10 for 25 weeks), \"I Wanna Be Loved\", \"There Will Never Be Another You\", and the inspirational \"The Three Bells\", which was an English version of the French 1946 rendition by Édith Piaf & Les Compagnons de la chanson; along with several solo recordings with Patty, including a cover version of Nat King Cole\\'s \"Too Young\", \"It Never Entered My Mind\", \"If You Go\" and \"That\\'s How A Love Song Is Born\".[citation needed]\"Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy\" can be considered an early recording of rhythm and blues or jump blues.[citation needed]While the sisters specialized in swing, boogie-woogie, and novelty hits with their trademark lightning-quick vocal syncopations, they also produced major hits in jazz, ballads, folk, country-western, seasonal, and religious titles, being the first Decca artists to record an album of gospel standards in 1950.[37] Their versatility allowed them to pair with many different artists in the recording studios, producing Top 10 hits with the likes of Bing Crosby[38] (the only recording artist of the 1940s to sell more records than The Andrews Sisters), Danny Kaye, Dick Haymes, Carmen Miranda, Al Jolson, Ray McKinley, Burl Ives, Ernest Tubb, Red Foley, Dan Dailey, Alfred Apaka, and Les Paul.[39][40] In personal appearances, on radio and on television, they sang with everyone from Rudy Vallee, Judy Garland and Nat \"King\" Cole to Jimmie Rodgers, Andy Williams, and The Supremes.[39][41] Some of the trio\\'s late-1930s recordings have noticeable Boswell Sisters vocal influences.[42]Maxene, Patty, and LaVerne appeared in 17 Hollywood films. Their first picture, Argentine Nights, paired them with another enthusiastic trio, the Ritz Brothers.[43] Universal Pictures, always budget-conscious, refused to hire a choreographer, so the Ritzes taught the sisters some eccentric steps. Thus, in Argentine Nights and the sisters\\' next film, Buck Privates, the Andrews Sisters dance like the Ritz Brothers.[citation needed]Buck Privates, with Abbott and Costello, featured the Andrews Sisters\\' best-known song, \"Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy.\"[44] This Don Raye-Hughie Prince composition was nominated for Best Song at the 1941 Academy Awards ceremony.[45]Universal hired the sisters for two more Abbott and Costello comedies and then promoted them to full-fledged stardom in B musicals. What\\'s Cookin\\'?, Private Buckaroo, and Give Out, Sisters (the latter portraying the sisters as old women) were among the team\\'s popular full-length films.[46]The Andrews Sisters sing the title song as the opening credits roll and also perform two specialty numbers in the all-star revue Hollywood Canteen (1944). They can be seen singing \"You Don\\'t Have to Know the Language\" with Bing Crosby in Paramount\\'s Road to Rio with Bob Hope, that year\\'s highest-grossing movie. Their singing voices are heard in two full-length Walt Disney features: \"Make Mine Music\"[47] in a segment which featured animated characters Johnny Fedora and Alice Blue Bonnet;[48] and \"Melody Time\", in the segment Little Toot, both of which are available on DVD today).[49]The Andrews Sisters were the most sought-after singers in theater shows worldwide during the 1940s and early 1950s, always topping previous house averages.[50][51][52] The trio headlined at the London Palladium in 1948[53] and 1951.[54] They hosted their own radio shows for ABC and CBS from 1944 to 1951,[55] singing specially written commercial jingles for such products as Wrigley\\'s chewing gum,[56] Dole pineapples,[57] Nash motor cars, Kelvinator home appliances,[58] Campbell\\'s soups, and Franco-American food products.[59] The western-themed \"The Andrews Sisters\\' Show\" (subtitled \"Eight-to-the-Bar Ranch\"), co-hosted by Gabby Hayes, began in 1944 and featured a special guest every week.[60]They recorded 47 songs with crooner Bing Crosby, 23 of which charted on Billboard, thus making the team one of the most successful pairings of acts in a recording studio in show business history. Their million-sellers with Crosby included \"Pistol Packin\\' Mama\",[61] \"Don\\'t Fence Me In\",[38] \"South America, Take It Away\", and \"Jingle Bells\".[62]The sisters\\' popularity was such that after the war they discovered that some of their records had actually been smuggled into Germany after the labels had been changed to read \"Hitler\\'s Marching Songs\". Their recording of Bei Mir Bist Du Schön became a favorite of the Nazis, until it was discovered that the song\\'s composers were of Jewish descent. Still, it did not stop concentration camp inmates from secretly singing it, this being most likely since the song was originally a Yiddish song \"Bei Mir Bistu Shein\", and had been popularized within the Jewish community before it was recorded as a more successful \"cover\" version by the Andrews sisters.[63]Edward Habib in the CD program notes for \"Songs That Won the War Vol. 2 The Hollywood Canteen\" states that the Andrews Sisters\\' radio transcription of Elmer\\'s Tune was \"so popular it even played on German radio,\" noting that \"the opposition embraced the Andrews Sisters and their songs in the same way the Allied Forces adopted Lili Marlene.\"Along with Bing Crosby, separately and jointly, The Andrews Sisters were among the performers who incorporated ethnic music styles into America\\'s Hit Parade, popularizing or enhancing the popularity of songs with melodies originating in Brazil, Czechoslovakia, France, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Mexico, Russia, Spain, Sweden and Trinidad, many of which their manager chose for them.[64][65]The Andrews Sisters became the most popular female vocal group of the first half of the 20th century.[66]Early comparative female close harmony trios were the Boswell Sisters, the Pickens Sisters, and the Three X Sisters.[citation needed]Highest chart positions on Billboard; with Vic Schoen and his orchestra, unless otherwise noted:(partial list)', 'AxelZwingenberger': 'Axel Zwingenberger (born May 7, 1955) is a blues and boogie-woogie pianist, and songwriter.[1] He is considered one of the finest boogie-woogie music masters in the world.[2][not in citation given]Zwingenberger was born in Hamburg, Germany, and enjoyed eleven years of conventional piano training. In 1973 he listened to recordings of boogie-woogie pianists Albert Ammons, Meade \"Lux\" Lewis, and Pete Johnson. He soon joined piano playing partners Hans-Georg Moeller, Vince Weber and Martin Pyrker, and word about the four friends began to spread. In 1974, he played at the First International Blues-and-Boogie Woogie Festival of the West German Radio Station in Cologne which was followed by Hans Maitner\\'s annual festival Stars of Boogie Woogie in Vienna.By 1975, Zwingenberger received his first recording contract, issuing such solo recordings as Boogie Woogie Breakdown, Power House Boogie, and Boogie Woogie Live, as well as lending his talents to recordings by such artists as Lionel Hampton, Jay McShann, Big Joe Turner, Lloyd Glenn, Joe Newman, Sippie Wallace, Mama Yancey, Champion Jack Dupree, Sammy Price, Ray Bryant, Charlie Watts, Bill Wyman, Vince Weber, and the Mojo Blues Band, among others. In addition to issuing other solo recordings, Zwingenberger continues to tour all over the world. He has also authored several publications about blues/boogie-woogie music and musicians as well as Boogie Woogie: Piano Solo, a book of 12 of his compositions, exactly transcribed.[3]Being a railfan since early childhood, he is also known for his photographs of steam locomotives,[4] including some taken from within the machinery itself. Zwingenberger established a non-profit foundation within the German Foundation for the Protection of Historical Monuments which donates for the preservation of monuments on rails, including the world\\'s fastest operational steam locomotive, the German DR 18 201.In spring 2009, coordinated by young pianist Ben Waters from the UK, Zwingenberger renewed his relationship with Charlie Watts, drummer of The Rolling Stones. Together with bassist Dave Green, they played joint concerts billed as The ABC&D of Boogie Woogie. In June 2012 they released their first joint album The ABC&D of Boogie Woogie - live in Paris and presented it in New York by playing concerts at Lincoln Center and The Iridium Jazz Club.Zwingenberger also appeared on Just For A Thrill by Bill Wyman\\'s Rhythm Kings', 'BigJoeDuskin': 'Big Joe Duskin (February 10, 1921 – May 6, 2007)[1] was an American blues and boogie-woogie pianist. He is best known for his debut album, Cincinnati Stomp (1978), and the tracks \"Well, Well Baby\" and \"I Met a Girl Named Martha\".He was born Joseph L. Duskin in Birmingham, Alabama.[1] By the age of seven he had started playing the piano. He played in church, accompanying his father, the Rev. Perry Duskin. His family moved to Cincinnati, Ohio, and Duskin was raised near the Union Terminal train station, where his father worked.[2] On the local radio station WLW, Duskin heard his hero Fats Waller play.[3] He was also inspired to play in a boogie-woogie style by Pete Johnson\\'s \"627 Stomp\".[4]In his younger days Duskin performed in clubs in Cincinnati and across the river in Newport, Kentucky. While serving in the U.S. Army in World War II, he continued to play and, in entertaining American servicemen, met his idols Johnson, Albert Ammons and Meade Lux Lewis.[3]After his military service ended, Duskin\\'s father caught him playing boogie in the church and made him promise to stop playing in that style while he was still alive. However, Rev. Duskin lived to the age of 105, and in the meantime, Joe found employment as a police officer and as a postal worker.[2] Effectively in the middle of his career, he never played a keyboard for sixteen years.[3]By the early 1970s Duskin had begun playing the piano at festivals in the US and across Europe. By 1978, and with the reputation for his concert playing now growing, his first recording, Cincinnati Stomp, was released on Arhoolie Records.[2] The album contained Duskin\\'s cover version of \"Down the Road a Piece\" [5] and featured Jimmy Johnson and Muddy Waters\\'s guitarist Bob Margolin.He subsequently toured Austria and Germany, and in 1987 he made his first visit to the UK.[3] The same year his part in John Jeremy\\'s film Boogie Woogie Special, recorded for The South Bank Show, raised Duskin\\'s profile.[3][4] In 1988, accompanied by guitarist/producer Dave Peabody, Duskin recorded his third album, Don\\'t Mess with the Boogie Man first released on Special Delivery Records. He was also a guest and invited to perform on the BBC program. Bravo. accompanied by The Rolling Stones drummer Charlie Watts.[3] In the following decade, Duskin performed at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival and the Chicago Blues Festival.[2]His touring in Europe continued before he recorded his final album at the Quai du Blues in Neuilly, France.[3] Several Duskin albums were issued on European labels in the 1980s and 1990s. It was 2004 before his third American release, Big Joe Jumps Again! (Yellow Dog Records) was issued; it was his first studio recording in sixteen years. It featured Phillip Paul (drums), Ed Conley (bass), and Peter Frampton on guitar.[2]Duskin was presented with a key to the city in 2004 by the mayor of Cincinnati.[2] The following year he was awarded a National Heritage Fellowship by the Ohio Arts Council.[3]Suffering from the effects of diabetes, Duskin was on the eve of having legs amputated, when he died in May 2007, at the age of 86.[3] The Ohio-based Big Joe Duskin Music Education Foundation keeps his musical ideals alive by producing in-school music presentations for public-school children.[2]Duskin said in 1987,', 'BigJoeTurner': 'Joseph Vernon \"Big Joe\" Turner, Jr. (May 18, 1911 – November 24, 1985)[1] was an American blues shouter from Kansas City, Missouri.[2] According to the songwriter Doc Pomus, \"Rock and roll would have never happened without him.\"[2] His greatest fame was due to his rock-and-roll recordings in the 1950s, particularly \"Shake, Rattle and Roll\", but his career as a performer endured from the 1920s into the 1980s.[2] He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987, with the Hall lauding him as \"the brawny voiced \\'Boss of the Blues\\'\".[2]Turner was known as The Boss of the Blues and Big Joe Turner—he was 6 feet 2 inches tall and weighed over 300 pounds, He was born in Kansas City. His father was killed in a train accident when Joe was four years old. He first discovered a love of music in his church. He began singing on street corners for money, quitting school at age fourteen to work in Kansas City\\'s nightclubs, first as a cook and later as a singing bartender. He became known eventually as The Singing Barman and worked in such venues as the Kingfish Club and the Sunset, where he and his partner, the boogie-woogie pianist Pete Johnson, became resident performers.[2] The Sunset was managed by Piney Brown. It featured \"separate but equal\" facilities for white patrons. Turner wrote \"Piney Brown Blues\" in his honor and sang it throughout his career.At that time Kansas City nightclubs were subject to frequent raids by the police, but, Turner said, \"The Boss man would have his bondsmen down at the police station before we got there. We\\'d walk in, sign our names and walk right out. Then we would cabaret until morning.\"His partnership with Johnson proved fruitful.[2] Together they went to New York City in 1936, where they appeared on a playbill with Benny Goodman, but as Turner recounted, \"After our show with Goodman, we auditioned at several places, but New York wasn\\'t ready for us yet, so we headed back to K.C.\" Eventually they were seen by the talent scout John H. Hammond in 1938, who invited them back to New York to appear in one of his From Spirituals to Swing concerts at Carnegie Hall, which were instrumental in introducing jazz and blues to a wider American audience.[2]In part because of their appearance at Carnegie Hall, Turner and Johnson had a major success with the song \"Roll \\'Em Pete\".[2] The track was basically a collection of traditional blues lyrics. It was a song that Turner recorded many times, with various musicians, over the ensuing years.In 1939, along with the boogie-woogie pianists Albert Ammons and Meade Lux Lewis, they began a residency at Café Society, a nightclub in New York City, where they appeared on the same playbill as Billie Holiday and Frankie Newton\\'s band.[2] Besides \"Roll \\'Em, Pete\", Turner\\'s best-known recordings from this period are probably \"Cherry Red\", \"I Want a Little Girl\" and \"Wee Baby Blues\". \"Cherry Red\" was recorded in 1939 for the Vocalion label, with Hot Lips Page on trumpet and a full band in attendance.[3] The next year Turner contracted with Decca and recorded \"Piney Brown Blues\", with Johnson on piano.[3]In 1941, he went to Los Angeles and performed in Duke Ellington\\'s revue Jump for Joy in Hollywood. He appeared as a singing policeman in a comedy sketch, \"He\\'s on the Beat\". Los Angeles was his home for a time, and during 1944 he worked in Meade Lux Lewis\\'s Soundies musical movies. He sang on the soundtrack recordings but was not present for filming, and his vocals were mouthed by the comedian Dudley Dickerson for the camera. In 1945 Turner and Pete Johnson established the Blue Moon Club, a bar in Los Angeles.Also in 1945, signed a recording contract with National Records, for which he recorded under the supervision of Herb Abramson. His first hit single was a cover of Saunders King\\'s \"S.K. Blues\" (1945).[4] He recorded the songs \"My Gal\\'s a Jockey\" and the risqué \"Around the Clock\" the same year, and Aladdin Records released \"Battle of the Blues\", a duet with Wynonie Harris. Turner stayed with National until 1947, but none of his recordings were big sellers.[3] In 1950, he recorded the song \"Still in the Dark\", released by Freedom Records.[4]Turner made many albums with Johnson, Art Tatum, Sammy Price, and other jazz groups.[5] He recorded for several record companies. He also performed with the Count Basie Orchestra.[2] During his career, Turner was part of the transition from big bands to jump blues to rhythm and blues to rock and roll. He was a master of traditional blues verses, and at Kansas City jam sessions he could swap choruses with instrumental soloists for hours.[citation needed]In 1951, while performing with the Count Basie Orchestra at Harlem\\'s Apollo Theater as a replacement for Jimmy Rushing, he was spotted by Ahmet and Nesuhi Ertegün, who contracted him to their new recording company, Atlantic Records.[2] Turner recorded a number of successes for them, including the blues standards, \"Chains of Love\"[6] and \"Sweet Sixteen\".[3] Many of his vocals are punctuated with shouts to the band members, as in \"Boogie Woogie Country Girl\" (\"That\\'s a good rockin\\' band!\", \"Go ahead, man! Ow! That\\'s just what I need!\" ) and \"Honey Hush\" (he repeatedly sings, \"Hi-yo, Silver!\", probably with reference to the phrase sung by the Treniers in their Lone Ranger parody, \"Ride, Red, Ride\"). Turner\\'s records reached the top of the rhythm-and-blues charts. Some of his songs were so risqué that some radio stations would not play them, but they received much play on jukeboxes and records.Turner had great success during 1954 with \"Shake, Rattle and Roll\", which seriously enhanced his career, turning him into a teenage favorite, and also helped to transform popular music.[2] During the song, Turner yells at his woman to \"get outta that bed, wash yo\\' face an\\' hands\" and comments that she\\'s \"wearin\\' those dresses, the sun comes shinin\\' through! I can\\'t believe my eyes, all that mess belongs to you.\"[7] He sang it on film for the 1955 theatrical feature Rhythm and Blues Revue.Although the cover version of the song by Bill Haley & His Comets, with the risqué lyrics partially omitted, was a greater sales success, many listeners sought out Turner\\'s version and were introduced thereby to rhythm and blues. Elvis Presley\\'s version of \"Shake, Rattle and Roll\" combined Turner\\'s lyrics with Haley\\'s arrangement, but was not a successful single.\"The Chicken and the Hawk\", \"Flip, Flop and Fly\",[6] \"Hide and Seek\", \"Morning, Noon and Night\", and \"Well All Right\" were successful recordings from this period.[3] He performed on the television program Showtime at the Apollo and in the movie Shake Rattle & Rock! (1956).[3]The song \"Corrine, Corrina\" was another great seller during 1956.[3] In addition to the rock music songs, he released Boss of the Blues album in 1956.[5] \"(I’m Gonna) Jump for Joy\", his last hit, reached the US R&B record chart on May 26, 1958.[2]After a number of successes in this vein, Turner quit popular music and resumed singing with small jazz combos, recording numerous albums in that style during the 1960s and 1970s.[2] in 1966, Bill Haley helped revive Turner\\'s career by lending the Comets for a series of popular recordings in Mexico.[3] In 1977 he recorded a cover version of Guitar Slim\\'s song, \"The Things That I Used to Do\".During the 1960s and 1970s he resumed performing jazz and blues music, performing at many music festivals and recording for Norman Granz\\'s Pablo Records.[3][5] He also worked with Axel Zwingenberger.[5] Turner also participated in a \"Battle of the Blues\" with Wynonie Harris and T-Bone Walker.[8]In 1965 he toured in England with the trumpeter Buck Clayton and the trombonist Vic Dickenson, accompanied by Humphrey Lyttelton and his band. Part of a studio concert was televised by the BBC and later issued on DVD. A sound recording of a club appearance made during this tour is not thought of sufficient sound quality to justify commercial issue. He also toured Europe with Count Basie and his orchestra.He won the Esquire magazine award for male vocalist in 1945, the Melody Maker award for best \"new\" vocalist of 1956, and the British Jazz Journal award as top male singer of 1965. In 1977, Turner recorded \"I\\'m Gonna Sit Right Down and Write Myself a Letter\" for Spivey Records, with Lloyd Glenn on piano. Turner\\'s career endured from the barrooms of Kansas City in the 1920s (when at the age of twelve he performed with a pencilled moustache and his father\\'s hat) to European jazz festivals of the 1980s.In 1983, two years before his death, Turner was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame.[9] That same year, the album Blues Train was released by Mute Records; the album featured Turner with the band Roomful of Blues.[2] Turner received top billing with Count Basie in the Kansas City jazz reunion movie The Last of the Blue Devils (1979), featuring Jay McShann, Jimmy Forrest, and other players from the city.Turner died of heart failure in November 1985, at the age of 74, in Inglewood, California, having suffered from effects of arthritis, a stroke and diabetes. He was buried at Roosevelt Memorial Park, in Gardena, California.He was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987.[10]The New York Times music critic Robert Palmer wrote of \"his voice, pushing like a Count Basie solo, rich and grainy as a section of saxophones, which dominated the room with the sheer sumptuousness of its sound.\"In announcing Turner\\'s death, the British music magazine NME, in its December 1985 issue, described him as \"the grandfather of rock and roll.\"[11]Bob Dylan mentioned Turner in the song \"High Water (For Charley Patton)\", from his 2001 album Love and Theft.Dave Alvin wrote a song about an evening he spent with Turner, entitled \"Boss of the Blues\", for his 2009 album, Dave Alvin and the Guilty Women. Alvin discussed the song in issue 59 of the Blasters Newsletter.[12]Dave Alvin later collaborated with his brother and former Blaster Phil Alvin on a second reunion album, Lost Time, released in 2015, containing four covers of songs by Turner, including \"Cherry Red\", \"Wee Baby Blues\" and \"Hide and Seek\". The brothers met Turner in Los Angeles, where he was playing in clubs on Central Avenue and living in the Adams district between tours in the 1960s. Phil Alvin opened for Turner a few times with his first band, Delta Pacific. Turner continued mentoring the Alvin brothers until his death in 1985. He is pictured on the back cover of Lost Time.[13][14][15]The biographical film The Buddy Holly Story refers to Turner and his contemporaries Little Richard and Fats Domino as major influences on Holly, who is portrayed collecting their vinyl recordings.Mississippi John Hurt wrote and recorded various versions of a song called \"Joe Turner Blues.\"[16] On a 1963 recording Hurt made for the Library of Congress, he said, \"best blues I ever heard was Joe Turner\", before playing a version of the song.[citation needed]Tracks marked with an asterisk were million-selling records.[18]', 'BigMaceoMerriweather': 'Major \"Big Maceo\" Merriweather (March 31, 1905 – February 23, 1953)[1] was an American blues pianist and singer, active in Chicago in the 1940s.[2]Born in Newnan, Georgia,[1] he was a self-taught pianist. In the 1920s, he moved to Detroit, Michigan, to begin his music career. He moved to Chicago in 1941, where he made the acquaintance of Tampa Red.[3] Red introduced him to Lester Melrose of Bluebird Records, who signed Merriweather to a recording contract.[4]His first record was \"Worried Life Blues\" (1941), which became a blues hit and remained his signature piece. Other classic piano blues recordings followed, such as \"Chicago Breakdown\", \"Texas Stomp\", and \"Detroit Jump\".[4] His piano style was developed from players like Leroy Carr and Roosevelt Sykes and from the boogie-woogie style of Meade Lux Lewis and Albert Ammons. He in turn influenced other musicians, such as Henry Gray, who credited Merriweather with helping him launch his career as a blues pianist.His style influenced practically every postwar blues pianist of note.[3] His most famous song, \"Worried Life Blues\", is a staple of the blues repertoire, with artists such as Eric Clapton performing it regularly in concert.[5] It was in the first batch of songs inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in the category Classic Blues Recordings – Singles or Album Tracks, alongside \"Stormy Monday\", \\'Sweet Home Chicago\", \"Dust My Broom\", and \"Hellhound on My Trail\".[6]Merriweather suffered a stroke in 1946.[3] He died of a heart attack on February 23, 1953, in Chicago and was interred at the Detroit Memorial Cemetery, in Warren, Michigan.[7]His recordings for Bluebird were released as a double album, Chicago Breakdown, in 1975. They have since been reissued on various labels.[7]In 2002, he was posthumously inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame.On May 3, 2008, the White Lake Blues Festival took place at the Howmet Playhouse Theater, in Whitehall, Michigan. The event was organized by executive producer Steve Salter, of the nonprofit organization Killer Blues, to raise monies to honor Merriweather\\'s unmarked grave with a headstone. The concert was a success, and a headstone was placed in June 2008.', 'BillPayne': 'William \"Bill\" Payne (born March 12, 1949 in Waco, Texas, USA) co-founded, with Lowell George, the American rock band Little Feat.[1] He is considered by many other rock pianists, including Elton John,[2] to be one of the finest American piano rock and blues music artists. In addition to his trademark barrelhouse blues piano, he is noted for his work on other keyboard instruments, particularly the Hammond B3 organ. Payne is also an accomplished songwriter whose credits include writing the Little Feat classic, \"Oh, Atlanta.\". Following the death of Little Feat drummer Richie Hayward on August 12, 2010, Payne is the only member of the group from the original four-piece line-up currently playing in the band.Payne has worked and recorded with other musicians including J. J. Cale, Doobie Brothers, Emmylou Harris, Bryan Adams, Pink Floyd, Bob Seger, Toto, Linda Ronstadt, Jackson Browne, James Taylor, Bonnie Raitt, Helen Watson, Stevie Nicks, Shocking Edison, Robert Palmer and Stephen Bruton. He was a guest performer on Bonnie Raitt\\'s album Sweet Forgiveness in 1977, and wrote its track, \"Takin\\' My Time.\"Paul Barrere and Bill Payne played several live concerts with Phil Lesh and Friends, from October 1999 through July 2000. Payne was a member of Boulder band Leftover Salmon [3] from 2014 until December 2015.In August 2015, Payne was selected to play keyboards for The Doobie Brothers after their keyboardist Guy Allison was called to work on an album project in Japan. In the few weeks of touring with the Doobies, he was featured with the band and Michael McDonald on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. Payne\\'s temporary term ended in early September after the Doobies\\' concert at the BB&T Pavilion in Camden, New Jersey. However, in December 2015 Payne rejoined the Doobies as a touring member, officially taking the position previously held by Allison.[4]Payne was a pioneer in the development of online music communities. In the early 1990s, he contacted his fan base and enlisted the help of friend Jay Herbst to develop the Little Feat Grass-roots Movement. This model went on to be a template for many bands in the creation of their Street Teams, which enlist the help of fans for purposes of music and concert promotion. This method has proven to be an effective vehicle for bringing bands and fans closer together, and forging friendships between them.Payne now also works as a commercial photographer.[5]Payne wrote or co-wrote many of the songs in Little Feat\\'s catalogue, including the following:reference #2 expired link', 'BlindJohnDavis': 'Blind John Davis (December 7, 1913 – October 12, 1985)[1] was an African-American blues, jazz and boogie-woogie pianist and singer.[2][3] He is best remembered for his recordings, including \"A Little Every Day\" and \"Everybody\\'s Boogie\".[1]Davis was born in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, and relocated with his family to Chicago at the age of two.[4] Seven years later he had lost his sight. In his early years Davis backed Merline Johnson, and by his mid-twenties he was a well-known and reliable accompanying pianist. Between 1937 and 1942, he recorded with Big Bill Broonzy, Sonny Boy Williamson I, Tampa Red, Red Nelson,[5] Merline Johnson, and others. He also made several records of his own, singing in his lightweight voice.[2]Having played in various recording sessions with Lonnie Johnson, Davis teamed up with him in the 1940s.[6] He recorded later on his own. His \"No Mail Today\" (1949) was a minor hit.[2] Most of Doctor Clayton\\'s later recordings featured Davis on piano.[7]He toured Europe with Broonzy in 1952, the first blues pianist to do so. In later years Davis toured and recorded frequently in Europe, where he enjoyed a higher profile than in the United States.[4]In 1955 Davis\\'s house in Chicago burned down. His wife died in the fire, and his collection of 1700 78-rpm records, some of them unissued, was destroyed.[8]Davis died in Chicago in October 1985, at the age of 71.', 'BlindLeroyGarnett': 'Leroy Roscoe Garnett, known professionally as Blind Leroy Garnett (August 6, 1897 – January 3, 1933)[1] was an American boogie-woogie and ragtime pianist and songwriter.[2] His two solo recorded compositions were \"Louisiana Glide\" and \"Chain \\'Em Down\", although scant details of his life and career are known.Garnett was born in Indianapolis, United States,[1][2] to parents Charles and Mattie Garnett (neé Georapy), who both hailed from Kentucky.[3] By 1910, all of the family had relocated to Chicago, Illinois, where he remained until at least 1930.[1] In 1918, Garnett was described as a \"piano player, not employed\", short, stout and \"totally blind\".[1] His playing style incorporated both boogie-woogie and ragtime, often termed \\'barrelhouse\\'.[2] Certainly \"Louisiana Glide\" was described as a \"good example of the barrelhouse style wherein melodic treble work is combined with a thunderous, driving boogie-type bass\".[4]He recorded a total of eight tracks for Paramount Records in 1929 and 1930.[2] These included two piano solos; \"Louisiana Glide\" and \"Chain \\'Em Down\", and on the rest he provided piano backing to James \"Boodle It\" Wiggins (four) and Marie Griffin (two tracks). It is known that two of his Paramount Records sides were recorded with Wiggins in Richmond, Virginia, in October 1929.[2]Garnett and Wiggins, the latter both a vocalist and pianist of some note,[1][2] worked jointly around East Chicago, and about which Wiggins sang on the song \"Shave \\'Em Dry\".[1] \"Shave \\'Em Dry\" gained more notoriety when performed by Lucille Bogan in 1935.[5]Garnett died of an intracerebral hemorrhage in Cook County Hospital, Chicago, in January 1933, aged 35. He was interred in Burr Oak Cemetery, Alsip, Illinois.[1]', 'BobBaldori': 'Bob Baldori (born 1943), also known as \"Boogie Bob\", is an American rock, blues, and boogie musician and attorney.

He has played Carnegie Hall several times, and major venues throughout Europe. He has released five albums and is working on a sixth with Bob Baldori.His greatest influence was Meade Lux Lewis. Seeley first met Lewis during a Detroit gig in the late 1940s, and a longstanding friendship through the 1950s and 1960s developed, which influenced Seeley\\'s piano styling. Seeley also played piano with Art Tatum. Eubie Blake was also among Seeley\\'s circle of friends.Seeley worked for a while as accompanist to Sippie Wallace. Seeley is an all-around pianist whose interest and repertoire span ragtime, stride, blues and boogie woogie.Seeley also has participated in the so-called \"Cheek to Cheek Boogie\" with Mark Braun AKA Mr. B.Peter Silvester wrote: \"His solos are notable for their coherence and logical progression, which propels them to a satisfying climax. Of all the contemporary pianists, Seeley reproduces the sound and spirit of Meade Lux Lewis with the most conviction and sometimes even surpasses the master\" (p.\\xa0247-248).', 'BoogieWoogieRed': \"Boogie Woogie Red (October 18, 1925 – July 2, 1992)[2] was an American Detroit blues, boogie-woogie and jazz pianist, singer and songwriter.[1] At different times he worked with Sonny Boy Williamson I, Washboard Willie, Baby Boy Warren, Lonnie Johnson, Tampa Red, John Lee Hooker and Memphis Slim.[2]He was born Vernon Harrison in Rayville, Louisiana,[2] and moved to Detroit in 1927.[1] In his adolescence, he began performing in local clubs and worked alongside Sonny Boy Williamson I, Baby Boy Warren and John Lee Hooker.[1]In the mid-1970s, Boogie Woogie Red played solo piano at the Blind Pig, a small bar in Ann Arbor, Michigan. He recorded his own albums in 1974 and 1977 and toured Europe in that decade.[1] Red appeared on BBC Television's Old Grey Whistle Test in May 1973.[3]He died in July 1992, at the age of 66, in Detroit.[2]\", 'BookerTLaury': 'Lawrence (Booker T.) Laury (September 2, 1914 – September 23, 1995) was an American boogie-woogie, blues, gospel and jazz pianist and singer.[1] Over his lengthy career, Laury worked with various musicians, including Memphis Slim and Mose Vinson, but did not record his debut album until he was almost eighty years of age.[2] He appeared in two films.[3]Laury was born in Memphis, Tennessee, and grew up with his lifelong friend Memphis Slim.[1] At the age of six, after helping his mother play the family\\'s pump organ, Laury learned to play the keyboards. His barrelhouse playing style, which he developed alongside Slim, was based on the influence of the Memphis performers Roosevelt Sykes, Sunnyland Slim, and Speckled Red. In the early 1930s, and in the company of the younger Mose Vinson, Slim and Laury began playing in local clubs.[2]In 1935, Sykes suggested to Laury and Slim that they relocate to Chicago, with a view to obtaining a recording contract. Slim took the advice, but Laury decided to remain in Memphis, where he played in gambling houses and clubs for decades. Laury had a large hand width, which enabled him to span ten keys. His playing dexterity was such that, after losing one finger on his left hand following an accident with a circular saw in the 1950s, he was still able to play well. Based around Beale Street, in Memphis, as that area started to degenerate, Laury traveled around Tennessee, Arkansas and Missouri. Despite differing fortunes, his friendship with Slim did not diminish over the years, up to Slim\\'s death in 1988.[2]Laury recorded his debut album in his late seventies.[2] A concert with a full band was recorded in 1980. A 1980 Paris concert was released by Indigo Records in France.[4]The 1989 Dennis Quaid film Great Balls of Fire! portrayed the young Jerry Lee Lewis and Jimmy Swaggart looking into a juke joint to see Laury playing \"Big Legged Woman\". The attention helped to give Laury an opportunity to record later in his life.[2] Laury appeared in the 1992 documentary film Deep Blues: A Musical Pilgrimage to the Crossroads,[3] in which he is shown playing \"Memphis Blues\" in his living room.[5]In 1994, Bullseye Blues Records issued Nothin\\' but the Blues, an album of Laury\\'s voice and piano, performing ten of his own compositions.[1] The same year, the Austrian label Wolf Records released a live album, containing concert recordings made in 1987.[6]Laury died of cancer in September 1995, at the age of 81, in Memphis.[2][5] He has a brass note on Beale Street\\'s Walk of Fame.[7][5][9]', 'CamilleHoward': 'Camille Howard (March 29, 1914 – March 10, 1993)[1] was an American rhythm and blues pianist and singer, who first came to prominence in Roy Milton\\'s Solid Senders in the 1940s. Her most successful recordings included \"R. M. Blues\" (as Milton\\'s pianist, 1945), \"Thrill Me\" (as singer with Milton, 1947), and her own \"X-Temporaneous Boogie\" (1948).She was born in Galveston, Texas, the daughter of Cecilia (née Hines) and Samuel Browning. Her birth was registered as Deasy Browning, but she grew up using the name Camille Agnes Browning.[1] She learned piano and, during her teens, was a member of a local group, the Cotton Tavern Trio.[2] By 1935 she was performing as a club musician in Galveston, as Camille Browning.[1]In the early 1940s, as Camille Howard, she moved from Texas to California. By 1943, she became a member of the Roy Milton Trio, who recorded for Lionel Hampton\\'s Hamp-Tone label in 1945.[3] Milton\\'s group then expanded to become a six- or seven-piece band, the Solid Senders, and they were signed by Art Rupe\\'s Juke Box label, which later became Specialty Records. Howard\\'s piano featured on singer and drummer Milton\\'s first hit, \"R. M. Blues\", recorded in December 1945, on which \"she plays seemingly unending, florid melodies with her right hand.\"[3] The record reached number 2 on the Billboard R&B chart, and number 20 on the pop chart, in early 1946.[4]The record was the first of many R&B hits for Milton on the Juke Box and Specialty labels.[5] Following its success, Howard also made her first recordings under her own name for the small Pan-American label in 1946.[3] She stayed with Milton\\'s Solid Senders, and was the featured piano player on all their hits through the late 1940s and early 1950s. She was the vocalist on their number 5 R&B hit in 1947, \"Thrill Me\".[4]After the success of \"Thrill Me\", Rupe began promoting her as a solo artist, and she had her first hit under her own name in 1948 with \"X-Temporaneous Boogie\", which reached number 7 on the R&B chart,[6] and sold close to a quarter of a million copies.[3] The track, a \"roaring instrumental\" in her characteristic \"two-fisted thundering boogie style\", was recorded with Milton and bassist Dallas Bartley, and was improvised at the end of her first recording session as leader, late on December 31, 1947; the following day, a ban on recordings imposed by the American Federation of Musicians came into effect.[3][5]She continued to play in Milton\\'s band, and Milton was also a member of her Trio for recordings; they may have been married.[1] Her own trio included Winston Williams (bass) and Walter Murden (drums), but she also performed occasionally with Milton, and toured with Jimmy Witherspoon, Little Willie Littlefield, Joe Liggins and others.[2]As well as continuing to record with Milton, Howard had 14 singles released under her own name by Specialty between 1948 and 1952, including both \"storming boogies and sultry ballads\".[3] Her R&B chart hits included \"You Don\\'t Love Me\" (1948), \"Fiesta in Old Mexico\" (1949), and \"Money Blues (If You Ain\\'t Got No Money, I Ain\\'t Got No Use For You)\" (1951).[6] She also recorded with Witherspoon, Lillie Greenwood, and others.[1]In early 1953, Howard signed with Federal Records, and released several more singles, but with diminishing success in the face of the growth of rock and roll.[5] She signed with Vee-Jay Records in 1956, and that year toured with Roy Brown, Little Willie John, The 5 Royales, and Joe Tex, but she had no more hits.[2]She retired from the music business shortly afterwards. She maintained strong religious convictions,[5] and in later years was unwilling to talk about her career in secular music.[3]She died in Los Angeles in 1993, aged 78.[1]', 'CarolineDahl': 'Caroline Dahl is an American pianist and composer of boogie-woogie and American roots music.She is originally from Louisville, Kentucky, where she played with the Metropolitan Blues All Stars. She has lived in San Francisco[1] for over 30 years, where she performs solo around the Bay area and with Tom Rigney & Flambeau.[2] She is locally known for her Sunday brunch performances at Mama\\'s Royal Cafe, and for her award-winning fiber arts.[3]The American Music Research Foundation calls Dahl \"a self-taught master of the American roots styles of Boogie woogie, Blues, vintage R&B, Jazz, Swing, and Country Swing.\"[4] She has headlined at festivals in the United States, Europe and Canada, including the International Boogie Woogie Festival in Switzerland,[5] the Festival de Blues in Barcelona, and the Motor City Boogie Woogie Festival in Detroit.', 'ChampionJackDupree': 'William Thomas \"Champion Jack\" Dupree (July 23, 1909,[1] or July 4, 1910[2] – January 21, 1992) was an American blues and boogie-woogie pianist and singer. His nickname was derived from his early career as a boxer.Dupree was a New Orleans blues and boogie-woogie pianist, a barrelhouse \"professor\". His father was from the Belgian Congo and his mother was part African American and Cherokee. His birth date has been given as July 4, July 10, and July 23, 1908, 1909,[1] or 1910; the researchers Bob Eagle and Eric LeBlanc give July 4, 1910.[2]He was orphaned at the age of eight and was sent to the Colored Waifs Home in New Orleans, an institution for orphaned or delinquent boys (about the same time, Louis Armstrong was also sent there as a child, after being arrested as a \"dangerous and suspicious character\"[3]). Dupree taught himself to play the piano there and later apprenticed with Tuts Washington and Willie Hall,[4][5] whom he called his father and from whom he learned \"Junker\\'s Blues\". He was also a \"spy boy\" for the Yellow Pocahontas tribe of the Mardi Gras Indians. He soon began playing in barrelhouses and other drinking establishments.He began a life of travelling, living in Chicago, where he worked with Georgia Tom, and in Indianapolis, Indiana, where he met Scrapper Blackwell and Leroy Carr. He also worked as a cook. In Detroit, after Joe Louis encouraged him to become a boxer, he fought 107 bouts, winning Golden Gloves and other championships and picking up the nickname Champion Jack, which he used the rest of his life.He returned to Chicago at the age of 30 and joined a circle of recording artists, including Big Bill Broonzy and Tampa Red, who introduced him to the record producer Lester Melrose. Many of Dupree\\'s songs were later credited to Melrose as composer, and Melrose claimed publishing rights to them.Dupree\\'s career was interrupted by military service in World War II. He was a cook in the United States Navy and was held by the Japanese for two years as a prisoner of war.After the war, his biggest commercial success was \"Walkin\\' the Blues\", which he recorded as a duet with Teddy McRae. This led to several national tours and eventually a European tour. In 1959 he played an unofficial (and unpaid) duo gig with Alexis Korner at the London School of Economics.Dupree moved to Europe in 1960, settling first in Switzerland and then Denmark, England, Sweden and, finally, Germany.[6] On June 17, 1971, he played at the Montreux Jazz Festival, in the Casino Kursaal, with King Curtis, backed by Cornell Dupree on guitar, Jerry Jemmott on bass and Oliver Jackson on drums. The recording of the concert was released in 1973 as the album King Curtis & Champion Jack Dupree: Blues at Montreux on the Atlantic label.[7]During the 1970s and 1980s he lived at Ovenden in Halifax, England.[8] A piano he used was later discovered at Calderdale College in Halifax.[9] He continued to record in Europe with the Kenn Lending Band, Louisiana Red and Axel Zwingenberger and made many live appearances. He also worked again as a cook, specializing in New Orleans cuisine. He returned to the United States from time to time and performed at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival.Dupree died of cancer on January 21, 1992, in Hanover, Germany.[10]Dupree\\'s playing was almost all straight blues and boogie-woogie. He was not a sophisticated musician or singer, but he had a wry and clever way with words: \"Mama, move your false teeth, papa wanna scratch your gums.\" He sometimes sang as if he had a cleft palate and even recorded under the name Harelip Jack Dupree. This was an artistic conceit, as he had clear articulation, particularly for a blues singer. He would occasionally indulge in a vocalese style of sung word play (similar to Slim Gaillard\\'s \"Vout\"), as in his \"Mr. Dupree Blues\", included on the album The Complete Blue Horizon Sessions.Many of his songs were about jail, drinking and drug addiction, although he himself was a light drinker and did not use other drugs. His \"Junker\\'s Blues\" was transmuted by Fats Domino into \"The Fat Man\", Domino\\'s first hit record.[6] Some of Dupree\\'s songs had gloomy topics, such as \"TB Blues\" and \"Angola Blues\" (about Louisiana State Penitentiary, the infamous Louisiana prison farm), but he also sang about cheerful subjects, as in \"Dupree Shake Dance\": \"Come on, mama, on your hands and knees, do that shake dance as you please\". He was a noted raconteur and transformed many of his stories into songs, such as \"Big Leg Emma\\'s\", a rhymed tale of a police raid on a barrelhouse.The lyrics of Jerry Lee Lewis\\'s version of \"Whole Lotta Shakin\\' Goin\\' On\"—\"You can shake it one time for me!\"—echo Dupree\\'s song \"Shake Baby Shake\".On his best-known album, Blues from the Gutter, released by Atlantic Records in 1959, he was accompanied on guitar by Larry Dale, whose playing on that record inspired Brian Jones of the Rolling Stones.In later years Dupree recorded with John Mayall, Mick Taylor, Eric Clapton and The Band.[6]Although best known as a singer and pianist in the New Orleans style, Dupree occasionally pursued more musically adventurous projects, including Dupree \\'n\\' McPhee, a collaboration with the English guitarist Tony McPhee, recorded for Blue Horizon Records.[11] [12]', 'CharlieNorman': 'Karl-Erik Albert \"Charlie\" Norman also known as Charles (4\\xa0October 1920\\xa0– 12\\xa0August 2005) was a Swedish musician and entertainer. Norman is regarded as Sweden\\'s leading boogie-woogie piano player in the 1940s,[1] but also an accomplished all-round pianist.[2] He collaborated with other artists such as Alice Babs and Sickan Carlsson. He wrote scores for a number of films and also starred as an actor in several. His boogie-woogie version of Edvard Grieg\\'s Anitra\\'s Dance earned him some notoriety in Norway.Born in Ludvika in central Sweden,[3] Norman became interested in music at an early age and played the trumpet in his school orchestra. At the time, he was also studying the piano. Norman\\'s parents did not want him to take up a career as a musician without first learning, what they considered, a more a proper trade. To please his parents, he began work as a lathe operator at ASEA.[3] In his spare time he started a dance orchestra where he played the piano. His dance orchestra entered an competition in Borlänge in 1937. Norman\\'s prowess as a pianist was recognized and he was invited to join the Sven Fors Orchestra.[2]Norman got his first professional job as a musician in the summer of 1937, with the Sven Fors Orchestra at the Societetsrestaurangen (\"High Society Restaurant\") in Varberg.[2] He made his radio debut in 1938.[3] After that, he worked with orchestra leaders such as Håkan von Eichwald[4] and Seymour Österwall. In 1942, Norman contracted tuberculosis and had to be hospitalized for an extended period of time.[2] While in hospital, Norman began to write arrangements for recording sessions and also prepared a correspondence course in arrangement for dance orchestras.In 1949, he married Dagny Knutsson.[3] They had a son Lennie and a daughter Lena.[2]At the beginning of 1940, Norman was already a skilled boogie woogie pianist and this musical genre became the most popular of his compositions and it also became his signature.[5] The boogie woogie style he played in was a success when his first record, Charlies Boogie, was released in 1941.[1]When Norman re-arranged Edvard Grieg\\'s classical \"Anitras Dance\" and renamed it \"Anitras Dance Boogie\" in 1949, it resulted in a major controversy. The Grieg Foundation in Norway were outraged and said that the performance \"violated Grieg\\'s artistic copyright\"[6] and his record company, Metronome, was forced to withdraw the remaining copies. By then the record had already sold in excess of 10,000 copies[2] and the \"Anitras Dance Boogie\" became one of the most requested pieces in Norman\\'s repertoire.[5]During the 1940s, Norman made several appearances abroad, including his television debut in Paris in 1947,[3] on a program that also featured the legendary Édith Piaf.[5] In 1949, Norman put together an orchestra to entertain US military personnel at the officer\\'s club in Frankfurt. Starting in 1950, Norman reached a larger audience through his radio shows. He hosted the radio series the Nattugglan (The Night Owl)[5] followed by The Charlie Norman Show and Charlie In School. In 1951, Norman formed a trio with Rolf Berg and Hasse Burman that toured and performed at a number of venues.Norman made many recordings with Swedish singer Alice Babs and one of these resulted in Sweden\\'s first gold record.[1] His collaboration with Babs became successful and lasted for years.[5] In 1990, Norman successfully persuaded her to make a comeback after her lengthy retirement to Spain. Norman was one of the artists in the popular radio program Dagens Revy (Today\\'s Revue) along with Gösta Bernhard, Sickan Carlsson and Stig Järrel. In television, Norman contributed to children\\'s programs and the family program Small Town. He wrote many film scores, for both short films and full-length features such as The Pot Travel, You\\'ve made your bed... and Dangerous Freedom.[7] He also wrote the score for the American television series, Foreign Intrigue of which 50 episodes were shown in Sweden.In addition to being a skilled pianist, Norman also had an excellent sense of humour and he has often been compared to Victor Borge. He wrote most of the material he used in shows. During the 1970s and 1980s Norman teamed up with his son, comedian Lennie Norman and Ronnie Gardiner for ten winter seasons on the Canary Islands where they entertained Swedish tourists. Norman also appeared in restaurant shows at the Berns and Bacchi Wapen restaurants in Stockholm, the restaurant Trädgårn in Gothenburg and Kronprinsen in Malmö.[2] In the 1990s, Norman often played with Robert Wells, a great admirer of Norman\\'s.[8]Norman died on 12\\xa0August 2005, in Danderyd, Sweden from skeletal cancer.[9][6]Films Norman participated in:[7]', 'CharlieSpand': 'Charlie Spand (born May 8, 1893; died after 1958)[1] was an American blues and boogie-woogie pianist and singer, noted for his barrelhouse style. He was deemed one of the most influential piano players of the 1920s.[2] Little is known of his life outside of music, and his total recordings amount to only thirty-three tracks.[3]There has been speculation about Spand\\'s place of birth. Allmusic stated that some claim he was born in Elljay, Georgia,[4] and a song he wrote, \"Alabama Blues\", refers to his birth in that part of the country. Various blues historians have cited Spand\\'s songs \"Levee Camp Man\" and \"Mississippi Blues\" as evidence of connections there.[3] According to the researchers Bob Eagle and Eric LeBlanc, he was born in Columbus, Mississippi, in 1893.[1]Spand was one of the boogie-woogie pianists, including William Ezell[5] and others, who performed on Brady Street and Hastings Street in Detroit, Michigan, in the 1920s. In 1929, Spand relocated to Chicago, Illinois, where he met and began performing with Blind Blake.Spand recorded twenty-five songs for Paramount Records between June 1929 and September 1931. The tracks were recorded in Richmond, Indiana, Chicago, and Grafton, Wisconsin. The 1929 Richmond sessions recorded seven songs with guitar accompaniment to Spand\\'s piano playing and singing. Most of these were directly attributed to Blake. During Spand\\'s most notable recording, he and Blake had a small conversation during the making of \"Hastings Street\".[4][6] Another such duet occurred on \"Moanin\\' the Blues\".[3]After a gap in his recording career, in June 1940 Spand recorded what were to be his final eight tracks, for Okeh Records.[4] They were made in Chicago, when Spand was backed by Little Son Joe and Big Bill Broonzy. After these recordings were made, no further reference to Spand has been found.[3] The researchers Bob Eagle and Eric LeBlanc state that the blues musician Little Brother Montgomery said in 1958 that Spand was still living in Chicago.[1]In 1992, Document Records issued The Complete Paramounts (1929–1931). Yazoo Records\\' Dreaming the Blues: The Best of Charlie Spand (2002) had enhanced sound quality, but without the chronological track order favored by Testament.[4]Spand\\'s track \"Back to the Woods\" has been recorded by Kokomo Arnold, Joan Crane and Rory Block. Josh White recorded Spand\\'s \"Good Gal.\"[7][8]', 'ClarenceWilliamsmusician': 'Clarence Williams (October 6, 1898[1][2] or October 8, 1893[3] – November 6, 1965)[1][2][3] was an American jazz pianist, composer, promoter, vocalist, theatrical producer, and publisher.Williams was born in Plaquemine, Louisiana, ran away from home at age 12 to join Billy Kersand\\'s Traveling Minstrel Show, then moved to New Orleans. At first Williams worked shining shoes and doing odd jobs, but soon became known as a singer and master of ceremonies. By the early 1910s he was a well regarded local entertainer also playing piano, and was composing new tunes by 1913. Williams was a good businessman and worked arranging and managing entertainment at the local African-American vaudeville theater as well as at various saloons and dance halls around Rampart Street, and at clubs and houses in Storyville.[3][4]Williams started a music publishing business with violinist/bandleader Armand J. Piron in 1915, which by the 1920s was the leading African-American owned music publisher in the country. He toured briefly with W.C. Handy, set up a publishing office in Chicago, then settled in New York in the early 1920s. In 1921, he married blues singer and stage actress Eva Taylor, with whom he would frequently perform.[3][4]He was one of the primary pianists on scores of blues records recorded in New York during the 1920s. He supervised African-American recordings (the 8000 Race Series) for the New York offices of Okeh phonograph company in the 1920s in the Gaiety Theatre office building in Times Square.[5] He recruited many of the artists who performed on that label. He also recorded extensively, leading studio bands frequently for OKeh, Columbia and occasionally other record labels.[3][4]He mostly used \"Clarence Williams\\' Jazz Kings\" for his hot band sides and \"Clarence Williams\\' Washboard Five\" for his washboard sides. He also produced and participated in early recordings by Louis Armstrong, Sidney Bechet, Bessie Smith, Virginia Liston, Irene Scruggs, his niece Katherine Henderson,[6] and many others. Two of his 1924 recording bands, \"The Red Onion Jazz Babies\" and \"Clarence Williams\\' Blue Five\" featured cornetist Armstrong and soprano saxophonist Bechet, two of the most important early jazz soloists, in their only recordings together before the 1940s. The rivalry between Armstrong and Bechet, who tried to outdo each other with successive solo breaks, is exemplified in \"Cake Walkin\\' Babies from Home\", the most celebrated of these performances, which survives in versions recorded by both bands.[7] King Oliver played cornet on a number of Williams\\'s late 1920s recordings. He was the recording director for the short-lived QRS Records label in 1928.[3][4]Most of his recordings were songs from his publishing house, which explains why he recorded tunes like \"Baby Won\\'t You Please Come Home\", \"Close Fit Blues\" and \"Papa De-Da-Da\" numerous times.[8] Among his own compositions was \"Shout, Sister, Shout\" (1929), which was recorded by him, and also covered by the Boswell Sisters, in 1931.[3][4]In 1933, he signed to the Vocalion label and recorded quite a number of popular recordings, mostly featuring washboard percussion, through 1935 (and a session in 1938).[3][4] He also recorded for Bluebird in 1937, and again in 1941.In 1943, Williams sold his extensive back-catalogue of tunes to Decca Records for $50,000 and retired, but then bought a bargain used-goods store. Williams died in Queens, New York City, in 1965, and was interred in Saint Charles Cemetery in Farmingdale on Long Island. On her death in 1977, his wife, Eva Taylor, was interred next to him.[3][4]Clarence Williams is the grandfather of actor Clarence Williams III.[1] His daughter Joy Williams (1931–1970) was a singer-actress under stage name Irene Williams.[citation needed]Clarence Williams\\' name appears as composer or co-composer on numerous tunes, including a number which by Williams\\' own admission were written by others but which Williams bought all rights to outright, as was a common practice in the music publishing business at the time. Clarence Williams was also credited as the author of Hank Williams\\' 1949 hit \"My Bucket\\'s Got a Hole in It\", a song that was later recorded by Louis Armstrong. In 1970, Williams was posthumously inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.[3][4]', 'CommanderCodyandHisLostPlanetAirmen': 'Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen is an American country rock band founded in 1967. The group\\'s founder was George Frayne IV (alias Commander Cody, born July 19, 1944 at Boise, Idaho) on keyboards and vocals.The band\\'s style mixed country, rock \\'n\\' roll, western swing, rockabilly, and jump blues together on a foundation of boogie-woogie piano. They were among first country-rock bands to take its cues less from folk-rock and bluegrass and more from the rowdy barroom country of the Ernest Tubb and Ray Price style. The band became known for marathon live shows.Alongside Frayne, the classic lineup was Billy C. Farlow (b. Decatur, Alabama) on vocals and harmonica; John Tichy (b. St. Louis, Missouri) on guitar and vocals; Bill Kirchen (b. January 29, 1948 at Ann Arbor, Michigan) on lead guitar; Andy Stein (b. August 31, 1948 at New York) on saxophone and fiddle; Paul \"Buffalo\" Bruce Barlow (b. December 3, 1948 at Oxnard, California) on bass guitar; Lance Dickerson (b. October 15, 1948 at Livonia, Michigan; died November 10, 2003 at Fairfax, California) on drums; Steve Davis (b. July 18, 1946 at Charleston, West Virginia) and Bobby Black on steel guitar.Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen formed in 1967 in Ann Arbor, Michigan, with Frayne taking the stage name Commander Cody. The band’s name was inspired by 1950s film serials featuring the character Commando Cody and from a feature version of an earlier serial, King of the Rocket Men, released under the title Lost Planet Airmen.After playing for several years in local bars, the core members migrated to San Francisco and soon got a recording contract with Paramount Records. (About a year later, Commander Cody invited western swing revival group Asleep at the Wheel to relocate to the Bay Area.[2]) The group released their first album in late 1971, Lost in the Ozone, which yielded its best-known hit, a cover version of the 1955 song \"Hot Rod Lincoln\", which reached the top ten on the Billboard singles chart in early 1972. The band\\'s 1974 live recording, Live from Deep in the Heart of Texas features cover art of armadillos by Jim Franklin. The band released several moderately successful albums through the first half of the 1970s. After appearing in the Roger Corman movie Hollywood Boulevard, Frayne disbanded the group in 1976.Geoffrey Stokes\\' 1976 book Star-Making Machinery featured Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen as its primary case study of music industry production and marketing. Stokes relates the difficulties the band had recording its first album for Warner Bros. Records. The label wanted a hit album along the lines of the soft country-rock of The Eagles, but the band was not inclined to change its raw-edged style.Kirchen and Stein went on to have successful musical careers. Tichy had previously earned a Ph.D. from the University of Michigan and became head of the Department of Mechanical, Aerospace and Nuclear Engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in Troy, New York.[2]\"Hot Rod Lincoln\", the band\\'s most famous recording, was voted a Legendary Michigan Song in 2008.[3] The following year Commander Cody And His Lost Planet Airmen were inducted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame.[4]Retaining his stage name of Commander Cody, Frayne had a subsequent solo career, touring and releasing albums from 1977 on. Later some unauthorized Lost Planet Airmen recordings were released in Europe and Australia along with previously unreleased LPA tracks and some outtakes from existing Paramount and Warner releases. Recent releases have been as \"The Commander Cody Band\" as well as \"Commander Cody and his Modern Day Airmen\". In addition to Frayne, current[when?] members of the band include Steve Barbuto on drums and Mark Emerick on guitar.Frayne is also an artist. He received a bachelor\\'s in design from the University of Michigan in 1966 and a master\\'s in Sculpture and Painting from the Rackham School of Graduate Studies of the University of Michigan in 1968. He taught at University of Michigan and the University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh, and has had his art exhibited at numerous shows.[5] He is a student of cinematography, and has a video (Two Triple Cheese Side Order of Fries) in the Museum of Modern Art\\'s permanent video archive. Some of his paintings are oversized, most are medium-sized acrylics and present pop art images from media sources and historic photos.[6] His book, Art Music and Life was released by Qualibre Publications in 2009 and is a mix of his best work and anecdotal comments and related stories. He still does portraits of famous automobiles for the Saratoga Auto Museum in Saratoga Springs, New York, where he currently resides.[when?]George\\'s brother Chris Frayne is credited with the cover art for the Lost in the Ozone, Sleazy Roadside Stories, Hot Licks, Cold Steel & Truckers\\' Favorites, and Country Casanova albums. He shared credit with George for the album cover for Aces High, and designed other album covers in the music industry. Chris Frayne died in 1992 of multiple sclerosis.[2]', 'CowCowDavenport': 'Charles Edward \"Cow Cow\" Davenport (April 23, 1894 – December 3, 1955[1]) was an American boogie-woogie and piano blues player as well as a vaudeville entertainer. He also played the organ and sang.He was born in Anniston, Alabama, one of eight children. Davenport started playing the piano at age 12. His father objected strongly to his musical aspirations and sent him to a theological seminary, where he was expelled for playing ragtime.[2]Davenport\\'s career began in the 1920s when he joined Banhoof\\'s Traveling Carnival, a medicine show. His first fame came as accompanist to blues musicians Dora Carr and Ivy Smith. Davenport and Carr performed as a vaudeville act as Davenport & Co, and he performed with Smith as the \"Chicago Steppers\".[3][4] He also performed with Tampa Red. Davenport recorded for many record labels, and was a talent scout and artist for Vocalion Records. Davenport suffered a stroke in 1938 and lost movement in his hands. He was washing dishes when he was found by the jazz pianist Art Hodes. Hodes assisted in his rehabilitation and helped him find new recording contracts.His best-known tune was \"Cow Cow Blues\". The \"Cow Cow\" in the title referred to a train\\'s cowcatcher. The popularity of the song gave Davenport the nickname \"Cow Cow.\"[4] In 1953, \"Cow Cow Blues\" was an influence on the Ahmet Ertegün-written \"Mess Around\" by Ray Charles, which was Charles\\'s first step away from his Nat \"King\" Cole-esque style, and into the style he would employ throughout the 1950s for Atlantic Records.\"Cow-Cow Boogie (Cuma-Ti-Yi-Yi-Ay)\" (1943) was probably named for him, but he did not write it. It was penned by Benny Carter, Gene de Paul and Don Raye. It combined the then popular \"Western song\" craze (exemplified by Johnny Mercer\\'s \"I\\'m an Old Cowhand\") with the big-band boogie-woogie fad. The track was written for the Abbott and Costello film Ride \\'Em Cowboy.Davenport claimed to have been the composer of \"Mama Don\\'t Allow It\". He also said he had written the Louis Armstrong hit \"I\\'ll be Glad When You\\'re Dead (You Rascal You)\", but sold the rights and credit to others.[1]Cow Cow Davenport, who also made recordings under the pseudonyms of Bat The Humming Bird, George Hamilton and The Georgia Grinder.,[3] died in 1955 in Cleveland, Ohio, of hardening of the arteries,[1] is a member of the Alabama Music Hall of Fame. Cripple Clarence Lofton called him a major influence. He is buried at Evergreen Cemetery in Bedford Heights, Ohio.[5]', 'CrippleClarenceLofton': 'Clarence Lofton (March 28, 1887,[1] 1896 or 1897 – January 9, 1957),[3] credited as Cripple Clarence Lofton, was an American boogie-woogie pianist and singer born in Tennessee.There is uncertainty over when and where he was born. Many sources state that he was born Albert Clemens in 1887, in Kingsport, Tennessee.[1] However, the researchers Bob Eagle and Eric LeBlanc state that, based on information in official records, he was born Clarence Clemens in 1896 or 1897, in Burns, Tennessee, and may have been adopted as Clarence Ramsey. They also concluded that Albert (or Elbert) Clemens, born c.1903, who was also a singer and pianist who recorded for Bluebird Records, was his brother.[3]Lofton was born with a limp, from which he derived his stage name, but he started his career as a tap dancer.[1] He then began performing in the blues idiom known as boogie-woogie and went on to perform in Chicago, Illinois. The distinctive feature of his performances was his energetic stage presence; he would dance and whistle as well as sing.[2] A description of Lofton in performance is provided by William Russell, in his essay \"Boogie Woogie\":No one can complain of Clarence\\'s lack of variety or versatility. When he really gets going he\\'s a three-ring circus. During one number, he plays, sings, whistles a chorus, and snaps his fingers with the technique of a Spanish dancer to give further percussive accompaniment to his blues. At times he turns sideways, almost with his back to the piano as he keeps pounding away at the keyboard and stomping his feet, meanwhile continuing to sing and shout at his audience or his drummer. Suddenly in the middle of a number he jumps up, his hands clasped in front of him, and walks around the piano stool, and then, unexpectedly, out booms a vocal break in a bass voice from somewhere. One second later, he has turned and is back at the keyboard, both hands flying at lightning-like pace. His actions and facial expressions are as intensely dramatic and exciting as his music.\"[4]With his distinctive performance style, Lofton became a mainstay in his genre. His first recording was made in April 1935 for Vocalion Records with guitar accompaniment by Big Bill Broonzy.[5] Lofton also accompanied Red Nelson on several sides for Decca Records in 1935 and 1936.[6] He later went on to own the Big Apple nightclub in Chicago and continued to record into the late 1940s, when he retired.[1]Lofton lived in Chicago for the rest of his life. He died of a blood clot in his brain in Cook County Hospital in 1957.[3][1]Lofton was an integral figure in the boogie-woogie genre in Chicago.[4] Some of his more popular songs include \"Strut That Thing\", \"Monkey Man Blues\", \"I Don\\'t Know\" and \"Pitchin\\' Boogie\". His talent was likened to that of Pinetop Smith and other prominent boogie-woogie artists, including Meade Lux Lewis, Cow Cow Davenport and Jimmy Yancey. Lofton was also said to have influenced Erwin Helfer.[7]', 'DeannaBogart': \"Deanna Bogart (born September 5, 1959, Washington, D.C., United States) is an American blues singer, pianist, and saxophone player.[1]She began her career in the Maryland-area with the ensemble Cowboy Jazz, and following that band's breakup in 1986, a stint playing with Root Boy Slim. In the early 1990s she began her solo career.In 2013, Bogart was nominated for a Blues Music Award in the 'Pinetop Perkins Piano Player' category.[2] Two years later she won a Blues Music Award in the 'Instrumentalist - Horn' category.[3]\", 'DorothyDonegan': 'Dorothy Donegan (April 26, 1922 – May 19, 1998)[1][2] was an American classically trained jazz pianist primarily known for performing in the stride piano and boogie-woogie style. She also played bebop, swing jazz, and classical music.[3]Donegan was born and grew up in Chicago, Illinois, and began studying piano in 1928.[2] She took her first lessons from Alfred N. Simms, a West Indian pianist who also taught Cleo Brown.[4] She graduated from Chicago\\'s DuSable High School, where she studied with Walter Dyett, a teacher who also worked with, among others, Dinah Washington, Johnny Griffin, Gene Ammons, and Von Freeman.[1] She also studied at the Chicago Musical College and, later, the University of Southern California.[5] In 1942 she made her recording debut. She appeared in Sensations of 1945 with Cab Calloway, Gene Rodgers and W. C. Fields and was known for her work in Chicago nightclubs.[3] She was a protégée of Art Tatum, who once called her \"the only woman who can make me practice.\"[6] (She said that Tatum \"was supposed to be blind...I know he could see women.\"[4]) In 1943, Donegan became the first African American to perform at Chicago\\'s Orchestra Hall.[6] She later said of this pathbreaking performance:In the first half I played Rachmaninoff and Grieg and in the second I drug it through the swamp – played jazz. Claudia Cassidy reviewed the concert on the first page of the Chicago Tribune. She said I had a terrific technique and I looked like a Toulouse-Lautrec lithograph.[4]In May 1983, Donegan, along with Billy Taylor, Milt Hinton, Art Blakey, Maxine Sullivan, Jaki Byard, and Eddie Locke, performed at a memorial service for Earl Hines, held at St. Peter\\'s Evangelical Lutheran Church in New York City.[7] Her first six albums proved to be obscure when compared with her successes in performance. It was not until the 1980s that her work gained notice in the recorded jazz world.[3] In particular, a recorded appearance at the 1987 Montreux Jazz Festival and her live albums from 1991 were met with acclaim. Even so, she remained best known for her live performances. She drew crowds with her eclectic mixture of styles and her flamboyant personality. Ben Ratliff argued in The New York Times that \"her flamboyance helped her find work in a field that was largely hostile to women. To a certain extent, it was also her downfall; her concerts were often criticized for having an excess of personality.\"[1]Donegan was outspoken about her view that sexism, along with her insistence on being paid the same rates as male musicians, had limited her career.[1] In 1992, Donegan received an \"American Jazz Master\" fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts, and in 1994, an honorary doctorate from Roosevelt University.[5] Donegan died of cancer in 1998 in Los Angeles, California.[5]', 'DrJohn': 'Malcolm John \"Mac\" Rebennack (born November 21, 1940), better known by the stage name Dr. John, is an American singer, songwriter, voice actor, pianist, and guitarist, whose music combines blues, pop, jazz, zydeco, boogie woogie, and rock and roll.[1]Active as a session musician since the late 1950s, he gained a cult following in the late 1960s following the release of his album Gris-Gris and his appearance at the Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive Music. He performed a wildly theatrical stage show inspired by medicine shows, Mardi Gras costumes, and voodoo ceremonies. Rebennack has recorded more than 20 albums and in 1973 scored a top-20 hit with \"Right Place Wrong Time\".The winner of six Grammy Awards, Rebennack was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by singer John Legend on March 14, 2011.[2] In May 2013, Rebennack was the recipient of an honorary doctorate of fine arts from Tulane University. He was jokingly referred to by Tulane\\'s president, Scott Cowen, as \"Dr. Dr. John\".[3]Born in New Orleans in 1940, Dr. John has said that his French lineage took root there some time in the early 1800s. Growing up in the Third Ward, he found early musical inspiration in the minstrel tunes sung by his grandfather and a number of aunts, uncles, sister and cousins who played piano. He did not take music lessons before his teens, and only endured a short stint in choir before getting kicked out.[4] His father, the owner of an appliance store and record shop, exposed him as a young boy to prominent jazz musicians like King Oliver and Louis Armstrong, who inspired his 2014 release, Ske-Dat-De-Dat: The Spirit of Satch. Throughout his adolescence his father\\'s connections enabled him access to the recording rooms of burgeoning rock artists such as Little Richard and Guitar Slim. From these exposures he advanced into clubs and onto the stage with varying local artists, most notably, Professor Longhair.[5]When he was about 13 or 14 years old, Rebennack met Professor Longhair, which started a period in his life that would mark rapid growth as a musician and the beginnings of his entry into professional music. He describes his initial impression of Professor Longhair noting not only his musical prowess, but his style: \"I was also fascinated that he was sitting out there in a turtleneck shirt with a beautiful gold chain with a watch hangin\\' on it, and an Army fatigue cap on his head. And I thought, Wow, I never seen nobody dressed like this guy. Just everything about the man was totally hip. And he had gloves on him, too, beautiful silk gloves. I\\'ll never forget this.\"[4]At age 16 he was hired by Johnny Vincent as a producer at Ace Records. There, he worked with artists like James Booker and Earl King, his musical experience expanding notably. He struggled through intermittent years of high school. While a student at Jesuit High School, he was already playing in night clubs, something the Jesuit fathers disapproved of. They told him to either stop playing in clubs or leave the school. He chose the latter. According to lore, this was the seed of his classic, \"Right Place, Wrong Time.\" Eventually he focused entirely on music. Thereafter an entry into heavy narcotics use would fuel his desire to get out of New Orleans and move to California where his character, Dr. John, was born.[5]In late 1950s New Orleans, Rebennack originally concentrated on guitar and he gigged with local bands including Mac Rebennack and the Skyliners, (Paul Staele/Dennis \"Bootsie\" Cuquet, drums; Earl Stanley, bass; Charlie Miller, trumpet; Charlie Maduell, sax; Roland \"Stone\" LeBlanc, vocals), Frankie Ford and the Thunderbirds, and Jerry Byrne and the Loafers. He had a regional hit with a Bo Diddley-influenced instrumental called \"Storm Warning\" on Rex Records in 1959. During these days he was an A&R man producing, with Charlie Miller, monophonic singles on 45s for Johnny Vincent and Joe Corona for such local labels as Ace, Ron, Ric and others. For these sessions he oversaw A&R and the rhythm section while Miller wrote the horn arrangements and headed up the horns. It was a productive team until Miller decided to move to New York and to study music formally.Rebennack\\'s career as a guitarist was stunted circa 1960, when his left ring finger was injured by a gunshot while he was defending singer/keyboardist Ronnie Barron, his bandmate, Jesuit High School classmate, and longtime friend, at a Jackson, Mississippi gig. After the injury, Rebennack concentrated on bass guitar before making piano his main instrument; pianist Professor Longhair was an important influence on Rebennack\\'s piano-playing style.Dr. John grew up with full exposure to the realities of New Orleans. Prostitutes, pimps, thieves and addicts all participated in the same nightlife scene that contributed to his development as a musician. During the 1950s, he sold narcotics and even ran a brothel. He was arrested on drug charges and sentenced to two years in a federal prison at Fort Worth, Texas. His sentence ended in 1965 and he left for Los Angeles.[6]He moved to Los Angeles in 1965 where he became a \"first call\" session musician in the booming Los Angeles studio scene in the 1960s and 1970s and was part of the so-called \"Wrecking Crew\" stable of studio musicians. He provided backing for Sonny & Cher (and some of the incidental music for Cher\\'s first film, Chastity), for Canned Heat on their albums Living the Blues (1968) and Future Blues (1970), and for Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention on Freak Out! (1966), as well as for many other acts.Dr. John was always fascinated with New Orleans voodoo, and in Los Angeles he developed the idea of the Dr. John persona for his old friend Ronnie Barron. He imagined it as an interesting stage show and an emblem to their New Orleans heritage. \"Well, there was a guy the name of Dr. John, a hoodoo guy in New Orleans. He was competition to Marie Laveau. He was like her opposite. I actually got a clipping ... about how my great-great-great-grandpa Wayne was busted with this guy for runnin\\' a voodoo operation in a whorehouse in 1860. I decided I would produce the record with this as a concept.\" Of course, he would assume the role of Dr. John himself, which came apprehensively.[7][clarification needed]He recalls reading about the original Doctor John in his youth, a purported Senegalese prince who came to New Orleans from Haiti, a medicinal and spiritual healer. The Doctor was a free man of color who lived on Bayou Road and claimed to have 15 wives and over 50 children. He maintained a fascination with reptiles and kept an assortment of snakes and lizards, along with embalmed scorpions and animal and human skulls. His specialization was healing, and as such, in selling gris-gris, voodoo amulets that protected the wearer from harm. Gris-Gris became the name of Dr. John the musician\\'s famed debut album, his own form of \"voodoo medicine\".[8]Beginning in the late 1960s, Rebennack gained fame as a solo artist after adopting the persona of \"Dr. John, The Night Tripper\". Dr. John\\'s act combined New Orleans-style rhythm and blues with psychedelic rock and elaborate stage shows that bordered on voodoo religious ceremonies, including elaborate costumes and headdress (reflecting and presumably inspired by Screamin\\' Jay Hawkins\\'s stage act). In 1970, when Howard Smith asked him where the name \"Dr. John the Night Tripper\" came from, he responded, \"Before that I was Professor Bizarre. Cats used to call me things like “Bishop” or “Governor” or somethin’ but they started callin’ me “Doctor” for a while, so I just hung it on myself for keeps.\" [9] On the earliest Dr. John records, the artist billing was \"Dr. John, The Night Tripper\", while the songwriting credits billed him as \"Dr. John Creaux\". Within a few years the \"Night Tripper\" subtitle was dropped, and Rebennack resumed using his real name for writing and producing/arranging credits.Gris-Gris, his 1968 debut album combining voodoo rhythms and chants with the New Orleans music tradition, was ranked 143rd on Rolling Stone′s \"The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\" list. Three more albums, Babylon (1969), Remedies (1970) and The Sun, Moon, and Herbs (1971), were released in the same vein as Gris-Gris.During early to mid-1969, Dr. John toured extensively, backed by supporting musicians Richard \"Didymus\" Washington (congas), Richard Crooks (drums), David L. Johnson (bass), Gary Carino (guitar), and singers Eleanor Barooshian, Jeanette Jacobs from The Cake, and Sherry Graddie. A second lineup formed later in the year for an extensive tour of the East Coast with Crooks and Johnson joined by Doug Hastings (guitar) and Don MacAllister (mandolin). Also in 1969, Dr. John contributed to the Music from Free Creek \"supersession\" project, playing on three tracks with Eric Clapton. Washington and Crooks also contributed to the project.By the time The Sun, Moon, and Herbs was released, he had gained a notable cult following, which included artists such as Eric Clapton and Mick Jagger, who both took part in the sessions for that album. This album served as a transition from his Night Tripper voodoo, psychedelic persona to one more closely associated with traditional New Orleans R&B and funk. His next album, Dr. John\\'s Gumbo, with drummer Fred Staehle serving as the band\\'s backbone, proved to be a landmark recording and is one of his most popular to this day.Along with Gris-Gris, Dr. John is perhaps best known for his recordings in the period 1972-74. 1972\\'s Dr. John\\'s Gumbo, an album covering several New Orleans R&B standards with only one original, is considered a cornerstone of New Orleans music. In his 1994 autobiography, Under a Hoodoo Moon, Dr. John writes, \"In 1972, I recorded Gumbo, an album that was both a tribute to and my interpretation of the music I had grown up with in New Orleans in the late 1940s and 1950s. I tried to keep a lot of little changes that were characteristic of New Orleans, while working my own funknology on piano and guitar.\" The lead single from the album, \"Iko Iko\", broke into the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart, eventually reaching #71. In 2003, Dr. John\\'s Gumbo was ranked number 404 on Rolling Stone magazine\\'s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.With Gumbo, Dr. John expanded his career beyond the psychedelic voodoo music and theatrics which had driven his career since he took on the Dr. John persona, although it has always remained an integral part of his music and identity. It was not until 1998\\'s Anutha Zone that he again concentrated on this aspect of his music wholly for a full album. \"After we cut the new record\", he wrote, \"I decided I\\'d had enough of the mighty-coo-de-fiyo hoodoo show, so I dumped the Gris-Gris routine we had been touring with since 1967 and worked up a new act—a Mardi Gras revue featuring the New Orleans standards we had covered in Gumbo.\"In early 1973 Thomas Jefferson Kaye produced an album featuring a collaboration with Dr. John, Mike Bloomfield and John Paul Hammond. This album, Triumvirate, was recorded in Columbia Studios, San Francisco, and Village Recorders, Los Angeles.In 1973, with Allen Toussaint producing and The Meters backing, Dr. John released the seminal New Orleans funk album In the Right Place. In the same way that Gris-Gris introduced the world to the voodoo-influenced side of his music, and in the manner that Dr. John\\'s Gumbo began his career-long reputation as an esteemed interpreter of New Orleans standards, In the Right Place established Dr. John as one of the main ambassadors of New Orleans funk. In describing the album, Dr. John states, \"The album had more of a straight-ahead dance feel than ones I had done in the past, although it was still anchored solid in R&B.\"[citation needed] It rose to #24 on the Billboard album chart. In July 1973, the single \"Right Place Wrong Time\" peaked at #9 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart,as well as peaking at #19 on the Hot Soul Singles chart.[10] A second single, \"Such a Night\", peaked at #42. Still in heavy rotation on most classic rock stations, \"Right Place Wrong Time\" remains his single most recognized song. Artists such as Bob Dylan, Bette Midler, and Doug Sahm contributed single lines to the lyrics, which lists several instances of ironic bad luck and failure.Dr. John attempted to capitalize on In the Right Place\\'s successful formula, again collaborating with Allen Toussaint and The Meters, for his next album, Desitively Bonnaroo – part of which a Tennessee festival took as its name – released in 1974. Although similar in feel to In the Right Place, it failed to catch hold in the mainstream as its predecessor had done. It did produce the single \"(Everybody Wanna Get Rich) Rite Away,\" which peaked at #92 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and to date is the last time he hit the Hot 100. It was his last pure funk album until 1994\\'s Television, although like his voodoo and traditional New Orleans R&B influences, funk has continued to heavily influence most of his work to the present day, especially in his concerts.In the mid-1970s Dr. John began an almost 20-year-long collaboration with the R&R Hall of Fame/Songwriters Hall of Fame writer Doc Pomus, to create songs for Dr. John\\'s releases City Lights and Tango Palace, and for B.B. King\\'s Stuart Levine-produced There Must Be a Better World Somewhere, which won a Grammy for Best Ethnic or Traditional Recording in 1982. Dr. John also recorded \"I\\'m On a Roll\" – the last song written with Pomus prior to his death in 1991 – for the now out-of-print Rhino/Forward Records 1995 tribute to Pomus titled Til the Night Is Gone: A Tribute to Doc Pomus. The tribute included covers of Pomus-penned songs by Bob Dylan, John Hiatt, Shawn Colvin, Brian Wilson, The Band, Los Lobos, Dion, Rosanne Cash, Solomon Burke, and Lou Reed. According to Pomus\\' daughter, Dr. John and her father were very close friends as well as writing partners. Dr. John delivered one of a number of eulogies and performed with singer Jimmy Scott at Pomus\\' funeral on March 17, 1991 in New York City.On Thanksgiving Day 1976 he performed at the farewell concert for The Band, which was filmed by Martin Scorsese and released as The Last Waltz. In 1979, he collaborated with the legendary Professor Longhair on Fess\\'s (another nickname for Henry Byrd) last recording Crawfish Fiesta, as a guitarist and co-producer. The album was awarded the first W.C. Handy Blues Album of the Year in 1980, and was released shortly after Longhair\\'s death in January 1980.By the mid-1970s, Rebennack had begun focusing on a blend of music that touched on blues, New Orleans R&B, Tin Pan Alley standards and more.In 1975, his manager, Richard Flanzer, hired legendary producer Bob Ezrin, and Hollywood Be Thy Name was recorded live at Cherokee Studios in Los Angeles, California. The studio was transformed into a New Orleans nightclub for the sessions.In 1981 and 1983, Dr. John recorded two solo piano albums for the Baltimore-based Clean Cuts label. In these two recordings he plays many of his own boogie-woogie compositions.Dr. John has also been a prominent session musician throughout his career. He played piano on the Rolling Stones\\' 1972 song \"Let It Loose\", and backed Carly Simon and James Taylor in their duet of \"Mockingbird\" in 1974, and Neil Diamond on Beautiful Noise in 1976. He also contributed the song \"More and More\" to Simon\\'s Playing Possum album. He played on three songs on Maria Muldaur\\'s 1973 solo debut album, including his composition \"Three Dollar Bill\". He sang on four songs and played piano on two songs on Muldaur\\'s 1992 Louisiana Love Call. He was co-producer on Van Morrison\\'s 1977 album A Period of Transition and also played keyboards and guitar. He contributed three songs as writer or co-writer (\"Washer Woman\", \"The Ties That Bind\", and \"That\\'s My Home\") and also played guitar and keyboards on Levon Helm\\'s 1977 release, Levon Helm and the RCO Allstars. He performed on the March 19, 1977 episode of NBC\\'s Saturday Night Live. He played keyboards on the highly successful 1979 solo debut album by Rickie Lee Jones and has toured with Willy DeVille and contributed to his albums Return to Magenta (1978), Victory Mixture (1990), Backstreets of Desire (1992), and Big Easy Fantasy (1995). His music has been featured in many films, including \"New Looks\" in National Lampoon\\'s European Vacation in 1985 and \"Such a Night\" in Colors in 1988. In 1992, Dr. John released the album Goin\\' Back to New Orleans, which included many classic songs from New Orleans. Many great New Orleans-based musicians, such as Aaron Neville, the Neville brothers, Al Hirt and Pete Fountain, backed up Dr. John on this album. He also performed as the first American artist at the Franco Follies festival in 1992.Dr. John’s longtime confidant and former personal manager, Paul Howrilla, was responsible for moving Dr. John from Los Angeles, CA to New York, NY and securing the \"crossover\" work, as well as modifying Dr. John’s image from the 1970s to the 1990s. Paul Howrilla was the brains behind the scenes, as Dr. John would attest. They remain close friends to the present day. Dr. John has also done vocals for Popeyes Chicken & Biscuits\\' \"Luv dat chicken...\" jingle, as well as the theme song (\"My Opinionation\") for the early-1990s television sitcom Blossom. A version of \"Do You Know What It Means To Miss New Orleans\" with Harry Connick, Jr. was released on Connick\\'s album 20 and VHS Singin\\' & Swingin\\' in 1990. Dr. John moved back to Louisiana in 2009.His movie credits include Martin Scorsese\\'s documentary The Last Waltz, in which he joins the Band for a performance of his song \"Such a Night\", the 1978 Beatles-inspired musical \"Sgt. Pepper\\'s Lonely Hearts Club Band\", and Blues Brothers 2000, in which he joins the fictional band the Louisiana Gator Boys to perform the songs \"How Blue Can You Get\" and \"New Orleans\". His version of the Donovan song \"Season of the Witch\" was also featured in this movie and on the soundtrack. In 1996, he performed the song \"Cruella de Vil\" during the end credits of the film 101 Dalmatians.He also wrote and performed the score for the film version of John Steinbeck\\'s Cannery Row released in 1982. His hit song \"Right Place Wrong Time\" was used extensively in the movies Dazed and Confused, Sahara and the series American Horror Story: Coven.Dr. John has also been featured in several video and audio blues and New Orleans piano lessons published by Homespun Tapes. Other documentary film scores include the New Orleans dialect film Yeah You Rite! (1985) and American Tongues in 1987.Between July and September 1989, Dr. John toured in the first Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band, alongside Levon Helm, Rick Danko, Nils Lofgren, Jim Keltner, Joe Walsh, Billy Preston and Clarence Clemons. The tour produced the 1990 live album Ringo Starr and His All-Starr Band.In 1997, he appeared on the charity single version of Lou Reed\\'s \"Perfect Day\". In the same year, he played piano on the Spiritualized song \"Cop Shoot Cop...\", from their critically acclaimed album Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space. Frontman Jason Pierce, a fan of Dr. John\\'s music, reciprocated by guesting on Dr. John\\'s 1998 album Anutha Zone along with drummer Damon Reece and guitarist Thighpaulsandra.He recorded the live album Trippin\\' Live with drummer Herman V.Ernest III, David Barard, bass, Tommy Moran, guitar, trumpeter Charlie Miller, tenor Red Tyler, and baritone sax Ronnie Cuber.In September 2005, he performed Bobby Charles\\' \"Walkin\\' to New Orleans\", to close the Shelter from the Storm: A Concert for the Gulf Coast telethon. This was for the relief of Hurricane Katrina victims, following the devastation of his hometown of New Orleans.In November 2005, he released a four-song EP, Sippiana Hericane, to benefit New Orleans Musicians Clinic, Salvation Army, and the Jazz Foundation of America. On February 5, 2006, he joined fellow New Orleans native Aaron Neville, Detroit resident Aretha Franklin and a 150-member choir for the national anthem at Super Bowl XL as part of a pre-game tribute to New Orleans. On February 8, 2006, he joined Allen Toussaint, Bonnie Raitt, The Edge, and Irma Thomas to perform \"We Can Can\" as the closing performance at the Grammy Awards of 2006. In 2014 he performed at the NBA All Star Game as did Pharell Williams and Janelle Monáe.On May 12, 2006, Dr. John recorded a live session at Abbey Road Studios for Live from Abbey Road. His performance was aired alongside those of LeAnn Rimes and Massive Attack on the Sundance Channel in the USA and Channel 4 in the UK. He has performed the opening theme music to the PBS children\\'s program Curious George, broadcast since 2006.On July 30, 2006, Dr. John performed a solo piano benefit for New Orleans composer and arranger Wardell Quezergue (King Floyd\\'s \"Groove Me\") at a New Orleans Musicians Relief Fund benefit at the Black Orchid Theatre in Chicago.[11] Special guest Mike Mills of R.E.M. was in attendance, along with an all-star funk band.Dr. John performed the theme music to the Fox drama K-Ville.In 2007, Dr. John contribute to Goin\\' Home: A Tribute to Fats Domino. He contributed \"Don\\'t Leave Me This Way\".In January 2008, Dr. John, was inducted into The Louisiana Music Hall of Fame. Later, in February, he performed at All-Star Saturday Night, part of the NBA All-Star Weekend hosted by New Orleans. Also in 2008, Dr. John released his Grammy Award-winning City that Care Forgot about Hurricane Katrina\\'s devastation in New Orleans.In the 2009 Disney film The Princess and the Frog, Dr. John sings the opening tune, \"Down in New Orleans\".He reigned as King of the Krewe du Vieux for the 2010 New Orleans Mardi Gras season. On May 13, 2010, Dr. John played alongside The Roots on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon (episode 246) and was warmly greeted by Jimmy\\'s first guest, Keith Richards. In June 2010, Dr John played at the Glastonbury festival, Shepton Mallet, UK.Dr. John played keyboards and had a major role in shaping Gregg Allman\\'s 2011 album Low Country Blues, which was produced by T-Bone Burnett.[12]In 2011, he collaborated with Hugh Laurie on the song \"After You\\'ve Gone\" on Laurie\\'s album Let Them Talk. Also in 2011, Dr. John, Allen Toussaint and The Meters performed Desitively Bonnaroo at the Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival in Manchester, Tennessee, as part of the festival\\'s tenth year celebration. The name of the festival was taken from the 1974 Dr. John album, Desitively Bonnaroo. The same year he was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame along with Neil Diamond, Alice Cooper, Darlene Love and Tom Waits.In 2012, he released Locked Down, a collaboration with Dan Auerbach of The Black Keys, who produces and plays guitar.[13] The album received very positive reviews for its raw, Afrobeat-influenced sound. The Los Angeles Times said that it showed Dr. John \"exiting a period of relative creative stagnation by creating something magical, the embodiment of everything he\\'s done but pushed in a clear new direction\".[14]In 2014, Dr. John released his Louis Armstrong tribute album, The Spirit of Satch,[15] on Concord Records USA and Proper Records in Europe. Dr. John described the inspiration of the album as Louis Armstrong coming to him in a dream and telling him \"do my music your way\". The album was co-produced and arranged by Sarah Morrow, Dr. John\\'s music director and trombone player. The Los Angeles Times said, \"Tribute albums come and go, but it\\'s a real rarity that can snap a listener to attention like Dr. John\\'s new salute to jazz founding father Louis Armstrong. \"Ske-Dat-De-Dat\" turns many of the songs Armstrong recorded inside out and upside down, fast-forwarding them to 2014 with hip-hop beats, funk grooves and wildly inventive horn arrangements that are the work of John and his co-producer and arranger for the project, trombonist Sarah Morrow.\"[16]In spring 2014, \"The Musical Mojo of Mac\", a New Orleans concert to honor Dr. John, was introduced by Brian Williams and kicked off by Bruce Springsteen singing \"Right Place, Wrong Time\", with Dr. John and an all-star band which included event producer Don Was on bass.Dr. John recorded \"Let \\'Em In\" in the Paul McCartney tribute album The Art of McCartney. \"It’s a wonder to behold, as the ageless Dr. John re-envisions “Let ‘Em In” as a laconic come on, an invitation to party or maybe something more, once a few more glasses have been raised\", wrote Something Else. \"At the same time, he ends up lacing the song with darker feelings, as well.\" [17]Foo Fighters\\' Dave Grohl interviewed Dr. John about music in the New Orleans-themed episode of their HBO series Sonic Highways. \"Revel in the way his interviews bring out the best in Buddy Guy, Dolly Parton, Joan Jett and Dr. John (including the hypnotic reveal of Dr. John’s given name)\", wrote a Decider reviewer.[18]From 2014 to 2016, Dr. John\\'s band was The Nite Trippers with music director Sarah Morrow. Dr. John and the Nite Trippers appeared at the Hollywood Bowl tribute \"Yes We Can Can\" for his late friend Allen Toussaint on July 20, 2016. Also performing Allen Toussaint compositions were New Orleans artists Irma Thomas, Cyril Neville, the band Galactic, and the Allen Toussaint Band.In October, 2016, double album and DVD of the concert, The Musical Mojo of Dr. John: Celebrating Mac and his Music, was released.[19][20][21]Members of Dr. John\\'s band The Gris Gris Krewe with music director Roland Guerin include New Orleans musicians Guerin, bass and vocals; Herlin Riley, drums and vocals; and Eric Struthers, Guitar. They performed \"Right Place Wrong Time\" in the video kicking off the 2017 NBA All-Star Game. Also in 2017, Dr. John was a headliner on The Last Waltz 40th Anniversary Tour with Music Directors Warren Haynes and Don Was, reprising his \"Such a Night\" performance from the original concert and film with The Band.Dr. John formerly had a heroin habit. He completed his final rehabilitation stint in December 1989 and is proud to have been free of the addiction with the help of the NA program for almost 30 years.[22]', 'EdenBrent': 'Eden Brent (born 16 November 1965 in Greenville, Mississippi[1] is an award-winning American musician on the independent Yellow Dog Records label. A blues pianist and vocalist, she combines boogie-woogie with elements of blues, jazz, soul, gospel and pop. Her vocal style has been compared to Bessie Smith, Memphis Minnie and Aretha Franklin.[2][3] She took lessons from Abie \"Boogaloo\" Ames, a traditional blues and boogie woogie piano player and eventually earned the nickname \"Little Boogaloo.\"[1]In 2006, she won the Blues Foundation\\'s International Blues Challenge.[4] Along with other awards, Brent garnered two 2009 Blues Music Awards - one for Acoustic Artist of the Year, the other for Acoustic Album of the Year (Mississippi Number One).[5] At The 14th Annual Independent Music Awards in 2015, Eden Brent won the award in the \"Holiday Song\" category for \"Valentine\".Eden Brent was born in 1965 and raised in Greenville, Mississippi. Brent studied jazz and music at the University of North Texas, graduating with a Bachelor\\'s degree in Music.[6]When she was 16, Eden Brent met the late blues pioneer, Boogaloo Ames, and began to teach herself how to play his style. Brent has said,\"By the time I was 19, I’d nearly become sort of a groupie. I’d go hear him and request certain songs because I wanted to hear them and sort of watch over his shoulder a bit and watch the way he was playing. Sometimes I’d request the same thing over and over and then go home and try to learn it. Finally, after a few failures of not being able to pick it up on my own I was bold enough to ask him to teach me.\"[7]In 1985, Ames took her under his wing for 16 years, nicknaming her Little Boogaloo.[8] This apprenticeship advanced Brent’s talents. She was featured alongside Ames in the 1999 PBS documentary, Boogaloo & Eden: Sustaining the Sound, and in the 2002 South African production Forty Days in the Delta.[9]Brent has appeared around the country at venues and events such as the Kennedy Center, the 2000 Republican National Convention, the 2005 presidential inauguration (sharing the bill with B.B. King), the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, the British Embassy, Portland’s Waterfront Blues Festival, the Edmonton Blues Festival, the annual B.B. King Homecoming, and aboard the Legendary Rhythm & Blues Cruise.[10]', 'EllaFitzgerald': 'Ella Jane Fitzgerald (April 25, 1917 – June 15, 1996) was an American jazz singer often referred to as the First Lady of Song, Queen of Jazz and Lady Ella. She was noted for her purity of tone, impeccable diction, phrasing and intonation, and a \"horn-like\" improvisational ability, particularly in her scat singing.After tumultuous teenage years, Fitzgerald found stability in musical success with the Chick Webb Orchestra, performing across the country, but most often associated with the Savoy Ballroom in Harlem. Fitzgerald\\'s rendition of the nursery rhyme \"A-Tisket, A-Tasket\" helped boost both her and Webb to national fame. Taking over the band after Webb died, Fitzgerald left it behind in 1942 to start a solo career that would last effectively the rest of her life.Signed with manager and Savoy co-founder Moe Gale[1] from early in her career, she eventually gave managerial control for her performance and recording career to Norman Granz, who built up the label Verve Records based in part on Fitzgerald\\'s vocal abilities. With Verve she recorded some of her more widely noted works, particularly her interpretation of the Great American Songbook.While Fitzgerald appeared in movies and as a guest on popular television shows in the second half of the twentieth century, her musical collaborations with Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, and The Ink Spots were some of her most notable acts outside of her solo career. These partnerships produced recognizable songs like \"Dream a Little Dream of Me\", \"Cheek to Cheek\", \"Into Each Life Some Rain Must Fall\", and \"It Don\\'t Mean a Thing (If It Ain\\'t Got That Swing)\". In 1993, Fitzgerald capped off her sixty-year career with her last public performance. Three years later, she died at the age of 79, following years of decline in her health. After her passing, Fitzgerald\\'s influence lived on through her fourteen Grammy Awards, National Medal of Arts, Presidential Medal of Freedom, and tributes in the form of stamps, music festivals, and theater namesakes.Fitzgerald was born on April 25, 1917, in Newport News, Virginia, the daughter of William Fitzgerald and Temperance \"Tempie\" Fitzgerald.[2] Her parents were unmarried but lived together for at least two and a half years after she was born. In the early 1920s Fitzgerald\\'s mother and her new partner, a Portuguese immigrant named Joseph Da Silva,[2] moved to the city of Yonkers, in Westchester County, New York, as part of the first Great Migration of African Americans.[2] Initially living in a single room, her mother and Da Silva soon found jobs. Her half-sister, Frances Da Silva, was born in 1923.[3] By 1925, Fitzgerald and her family had moved to nearby School Street, then a predominantly poor Italian area.[3] She began her formal education at the age of six and proved to be an outstanding student, moving through a variety of schools before attending Benjamin Franklin Junior High School from 1929.[4]Fitzgerald had been passionate about dancing from third grade, being a fan of Earl \"Snakehips\" Tucker in particular, and would perform for her peers on the way to school and at lunchtime.[5] Fitzgerald and her family were Methodists and were active in the Bethany African Methodist Episcopal Church, and she regularly attended worship services, Bible study, and Sunday school.[5] The church provided Fitzgerald with her earliest experiences in formal music making, and she may also have had a short series of piano lessons during this period.[6]During this period Fitzgerald listened to jazz recordings by Louis Armstrong, Bing Crosby, and The Boswell Sisters. Fitzgerald idolized the Boswell Sisters\\' lead singer Connee Boswell, later saying, \"My mother brought home one of her records, and I fell in love with it....I tried so hard to sound just like her.\"[7]In 1932, her mother died from serious injuries she received in a car accident [8] when Fitzgerald was 15 years of age. This left her at first in the care of her stepfather but before the end of April 1933, she had moved in with her aunt in Harlem.[9] This seemingly swift change in her circumstances, reinforced by what Fitzgerald biographer Stuart Nicholson describes as rumors of her stepfather\\'s \"ill treatment\" of Fitzgerald, leaves him to speculate that Da Silva might have abused her.[9]Following these traumas, Fitzgerald began skipping school and letting her grades suffer. During this period she worked at times as a lookout at a bordello and with a Mafia-affiliated numbers runner.[10] Ella Fitzgerald never talked publicly about this time in her life.[11] When the authorities caught up with her, she was first placed in the Colored Orphan Asylum in Riverdale, in the Bronx.[12] However, when the orphanage proved too crowded, she was moved to the New York Training School for Girls in Hudson, New York, a state reformatory located about 120 miles north of New York City. Eventually she escaped and for a time she was homeless.While she seems to have survived during 1933 and 1934 in part from singing on the streets of Harlem, Fitzgerald made her most important amateur singing debut at age 17 on November 21, 1934, in one of the earliest of the famous Amateur Nights at the Apollo Theater.[13][14] She had originally intended to go on stage and dance, but, intimidated by a local dance duo called the Edwards Sisters, she opted to sing instead.[14][15] Performing in the style of Connee Boswell, she sang \"Judy\" and \"The Object of My Affection\" and won the first prize of $25.00.[16] In theory, she also won the chance to perform at the Apollo for a week but, seemingly because of her disheveled appearance, the theater never gave her that part of her prize.[17]In January 1935 Fitzgerald won the chance to perform for a week with the Tiny Bradshaw band at the Harlem Opera House.[13] Around this same time, she was introduced to the drummer and bandleader Chick Webb, who had asked his recently signed singer Charlie Linton to help find him a female singer. Though Webb was, as The New York Times later wrote, \"reluctant to sign her....because she was gawky and unkempt, a \\'diamond in the rough,\\'\"[7] he offered her the opportunity to test with his band when they played a dance at Yale University.[13]Met with approval by both audiences and her fellow musicians, Fitzgerald was asked to join Webb\\'s orchestra and soon gained acclaim as part of the group\\'s renowned performances at Harlem\\'s Savoy Ballroom.[13] Fitzgerald recorded several hit songs with them, including \"Love and Kisses\" and \"(If You Can\\'t Sing It) You\\'ll Have to Swing It (Mr. Paganini)\".[13] But it was her 1938 version of the nursery rhyme, \"A-Tisket, A-Tasket,\" a song she co-wrote, that brought her wide public acclaim.[18][19] Later that year Ella recorded her second hit, \"I Found My Yellow Basket.\"Webb died of spinal tuberculosis on June 16, 1939,[20] and his band was renamed Ella and her Famous Orchestra, with Fitzgerald taking on the role of nominal bandleader.[21] Fitzgerald recorded nearly 150 songs with Webb\\'s orchestra between 1935 and its final end in 1942. In her New York Times obituary of 1996, Stephen Holder echoed the conventional critical view of the time in describing \"the majority\" of her recordings during this period as \"novelties and disposable pop fluff\".[7] In addition to her work with Webb, Fitzgerald performed and recorded with the Benny Goodman Orchestra. She had her own side project, too, known as Ella Fitzgerald and Her Savoy Eight.In 1942, Fitzgerald left the band to begin a solo career.[22] Continuing under contract to the Decca label that she had worked with while part of Webb\\'s orchestra, she had several popular hits while recording with such artists as Bill Kenny & the Ink Spots,[23] Louis Jordan,[24] and the Delta Rhythm Boys.[25]With Decca\\'s Milt Gabler as her manager, Fitzgerald began working regularly for the jazz impresario Norman Granz and appeared regularly in his Jazz at the Philharmonic (JATP) concerts. Her relationship with Granz was further cemented when he became her manager, although it would be nearly a decade before he could record her on one of his many record labels.With the demise of the Swing era and the decline of the great touring big bands, a major change in jazz music occurred. The advent of bebop led to new developments in Fitzgerald\\'s vocal style, influenced by her work with Dizzy Gillespie\\'s big band. It was in this period that Fitzgerald started including scat singing as a major part of her performance repertoire. While singing with Gillespie, Fitzgerald recalled, \"I just tried to do [with my voice] what I heard the horns in the band doing.\"[16]Her 1945 scat recording of \"Flying Home\" arranged by Vic Schoen would later be described by The New York Times as \"one of the most influential vocal jazz records of the decade....Where other singers, most notably Louis Armstrong, had tried similar improvisation, no one before Miss Fitzgerald employed the technique with such dazzling inventiveness.\"[7] Her bebop recording of \"Oh, Lady Be Good!\" (1947) was similarly popular and increased her reputation as one of the leading jazz vocalists.[26]Ella Fitzgerald made her first tour of Australia in July 1954 for the Australian-based American promoter Lee Gordon. This was the first of Gordon\\'s famous \"Big Show\" promotions and the \\'package\\' tour also included Buddy Rich, Artie Shaw and comedian Jerry Colonna. Although the tour was a big hit with audiences and set a new box office record for Australia, it was marred by an ugly incident of racial discrimination that caused Fitzgerald to miss the first two concerts in Sydney, and Gordon had to arrange two later free concerts to compensate ticket holders. Although the four members of Fitzgerald\\'s entourage - Fitzgerald, her pianist John Lewis, her assistant (and cousin) Georgiana Henry, and manager Norman Granz - all had first-class tickets on their scheduled Pan-American Airlines flight from Honolulu to Sydney, Fitzgerald, Henry and Lewis were ordered to leave the aircraft after they had already boarded and they were even refused permission to re-board the aircraft to retrieve their luggage and clothing, and as as result they were stranded in Honolulu for three days before they could get another flight to Sydney. Although a contemporary Australian press report[27] quoted an Australian Pan-Am spokesperson who denied that the incident was racially based, Fitzgerald, Henry, Lewis and Granz filed a civil suit for racial discrimination against Pan-Am in December 1954[28] and in a 1970 television interview Fitzgerald confirmed that they had won the suit and received what she described as a \"nice settlement\".Fitzgerald was still performing at Granz\\'s JATP concerts by 1955. She left Decca and Granz, now her manager, created Verve Records around her. She later described the period as strategically crucial, saying, \"I had gotten to the point where I was only singing be-bop. I thought be-bop was \\'it\\', and that all I had to do was go some place and sing bop. But it finally got to the point where I had no place to sing. I realized then that there was more to music than bop. Norman ... felt that I should do other things, so he produced Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Cole Porter Song Book with me. It was a turning point in my life.\"[7]On March 15, 1955[29] Ella Fitzgerald opened her initial engagement at the Mocambo nightclub in Hollywood,[30] after Marilyn Monroe lobbied the owner for the booking.[31] The booking was instrumental in Fitzgerald\\'s career. Bonnie Greer dramatized the incident as the musical drama, Marilyn and Ella, in 2008. It had previously been widely reported that Fitzgerald was the first black performer to play the Mocambo, following Monroe\\'s intervention, but this is not true. African-American singers Herb Jeffries,[32] Eartha Kitt,[33] and Joyce Bryant[34] all played the Mocambo in 1952 and 1953, according to stories published at the time in Jet magazine and Billboard.Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Cole Porter Song Book, released in 1956, was the first of eight Songbook sets Fitzgerald would record for Verve at irregular intervals from 1956 to 1964. The composers and lyricists spotlighted on each set, taken together, represent the greatest part of the cultural canon known as the Great American Songbook. Her song selections ranged from standards to rarities and represented an attempt by Fitzgerald to cross over into a non-jazz audience. The sets are the most well-known items in her discography.Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Duke Ellington Song Book was the only Songbook on which the composer she interpreted played with her. Duke Ellington and his longtime collaborator Billy Strayhorn both appeared on exactly half the set\\'s 38 tracks and wrote two new pieces of music for the album: \"The E and D Blues\" and a four-movement musical portrait of Fitzgerald (the only Songbook track on which Fitzgerald does not sing). The Songbook series ended up becoming the singer\\'s most critically acclaimed and commercially successful work, and probably her most significant offering to American culture. The New York Times wrote in 1996, \"These albums were among the first pop records to devote such serious attention to individual songwriters, and they were instrumental in establishing the pop album as a vehicle for serious musical exploration.\"[7]Days after Fitzgerald\\'s death, The New York Times columnist Frank Rich wrote that in the Songbook series Fitzgerald \"performed a cultural transaction as extraordinary as Elvis\\' contemporaneous integration of white and African American soul. Here was a black woman popularizing urban songs often written by immigrant Jews to a national audience of predominantly white Christians.\"[10] Frank Sinatra, out of respect for Fitzgerald, prohibited Capitol Records from re-releasing his own recordings in separate albums for individual composers in the same way.[citation needed]Fitzgerald also recorded albums exclusively devoted to the songs of Porter and Gershwin in 1972 and 1983; the albums being, respectively, Ella Loves Cole and Nice Work If You Can Get It. A later collection devoted to a single composer was released during her time with Pablo Records, Ella Abraça Jobim, featuring the songs of Antônio Carlos Jobim.While recording the Songbooks and the occasional studio album, Fitzgerald toured 40 to 45 weeks per year in the United States and internationally, under the tutelage of Norman Granz. Granz helped solidify her position as one of the leading live jazz performers.[7] In 1961 Fitzgerald bought a house in the Klampenborg district of Copenhagen, Denmark, after she began a relationship with a Danish man. Though the relationship ended after a year, Fitzgerald regularly returned to Denmark over the next three years, and even considered buying a jazz club there. The house was sold in 1963, and Fitzgerald permanently returned to the United States.[35]There are several live albums on Verve that are highly regarded by critics. At the Opera House shows a typical JATP set from Fitzgerald. Ella in Rome and Twelve Nights in Hollywood display her vocal jazz canon. Ella in Berlin is still one of her best-selling albums; it includes a Grammy-winning performance of \"Mack the Knife\" in which she forgets the lyrics but improvises magnificently to compensate.Verve Records was sold to MGM in 1963 for $3 million and in 1967 MGM failed to renew Fitzgerald\\'s contract. Over the next five years she flitted between Atlantic, Capitol and Reprise. Her material at this time represented a departure from her typical jazz repertoire. For Capitol she recorded Brighten the Corner, an album of hymns, Ella Fitzgerald\\'s Christmas, an album of traditional Christmas carols, Misty Blue, a country and western-influenced album, and 30 by Ella, a series of six medleys that fulfilled her obligations for the label. During this period, she had her last US chart single with a cover of Smokey Robinson\\'s \"Get Ready\", previously a hit for the Temptations, and some months later a top-five hit for Rare Earth.The surprise success of the 1972 album Jazz at Santa Monica Civic \\'72 led Granz to found Pablo Records, his first record label since the sale of Verve. Fitzgerald recorded some 20 albums for the label. Ella in London recorded live in 1974 with pianist Tommy Flanagan, guitarist Joe Pass, bassist Keter Betts and drummer Bobby Durham, was considered by many to be some of her best work. The following year she again performed with Joe Pass on German television station NDR in Hamburg. Her years with Pablo Records also documented the decline in her voice. \"She frequently used shorter, stabbing phrases, and her voice was harder, with a wider vibrato\", one biographer wrote.[36] Plagued by health problems, Fitzgerald made her last recording in 1991 and her last public performances in 1993.[37]In her most notable screen role, Fitzgerald played the part of singer Maggie Jackson in Jack Webb\\'s 1955 jazz film Pete Kelly\\'s Blues.[38] The film costarred Janet Leigh and singer Peggy Lee.[39] Even though she had already worked in the movies (she had sung briefly in the 1942 Abbott and Costello film Ride \\'Em Cowboy),[40] she was \"delighted\" when Norman Granz negotiated the role for her, and, \"at the time....considered her role in the Warner Brothers movie the biggest thing ever to have happened to her.\"[36] Amid The New York Times pan of the film when it opened in August 1955, the reviewer wrote, \"About five minutes (out of ninety-five) suggest the picture this might have been. Take the ingenious prologue ... [or] take the fleeting scenes when the wonderful Ella Fitzgerald, allotted a few spoken lines, fills the screen and sound track with her strong mobile features and voice.\"[41] Fitzgerald\\'s race precluded major big-screen success. After Pete Kelly\\'s Blues, she appeared in sporadic movie cameos, in St. Louis Blues (1958),[42] and Let No Man Write My Epitaph (1960).[43] Much later, she appeared in the 1980s television drama The White Shadow.She made numerous guest appearances on television shows, singing on The Frank Sinatra Show, The Andy Williams Show, The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom, and alongside other greats Nat King Cole, Dean Martin, Mel Tormé, and many others. She was also frequently featured on The Ed Sullivan Show. Perhaps her most unusual and intriguing performance was of the \"Three Little Maids\" song from Gilbert and Sullivan\\'s comic operetta The Mikado alongside Joan Sutherland and Dinah Shore on Shore\\'s weekly variety series in 1963. A performance at Ronnie Scott\\'s Jazz Club in London was filmed and shown on the BBC. Fitzgerald also made a one-off appearance alongside Sarah Vaughan and Pearl Bailey on a 1979 television special honoring Bailey. In 1980, she performed a medley of standards in a duet with Karen Carpenter on the Carpenters\\' television program Music, Music, Music.[44]Fitzgerald also appeared in TV commercials, her most memorable being an ad for Memorex.[45] In the commercials, she sang a note that shattered a glass while being recorded on a Memorex cassette tape.[46] The tape was played back and the recording also broke another glass, asking: \"Is it live, or is it Memorex?\"[46] She also appeared in a number of commercials for Kentucky Fried Chicken, singing and scatting to the fast-food chain\\'s longtime slogan, \"We do chicken right!\"[47] Her last commercial campaign was for American Express, in which she was photographed by Annie Leibovitz.[48]Fitzgerald\\'s most famous collaborations were with the vocal quartet Bill Kenny & the Ink Spots, trumpeter Louis Armstrong, the guitarist Joe Pass, and the bandleaders Count Basie and Duke Ellington.Fitzgerald had a number of famous jazz musicians and soloists as sidemen over her long career. The trumpeters Roy Eldridge and Dizzy Gillespie, the guitarist Herb Ellis, and the pianists Tommy Flanagan, Oscar Peterson, Lou Levy, Paul Smith, Jimmy Rowles, and Ellis Larkins all worked with Ella mostly in live, small group settings.Possibly Fitzgerald\\'s greatest unrealized collaboration (in terms of popular music) was a studio or live album with Frank Sinatra. The two appeared on the same stage only periodically over the years, in television specials in 1958 and 1959, and again on 1967\\'s A Man and His Music + Ella + Jobim, a show that also featured Antônio Carlos Jobim. Pianist Paul Smith has said, \"Ella loved working with [Frank]. Sinatra gave her his dressing-room on A Man and His Music and couldn\\'t do enough for her.\" When asked, Norman Granz would cite \"complex contractual reasons\" for the fact that the two artists never recorded together.[36][49] Fitzgerald\\'s appearance with Sinatra and Count Basie in June 1974 for a series of concerts at Caesars Palace, Las Vegas, was seen as an important incentive for Sinatra to return from his self-imposed retirement of the early 1970s. The shows were a great success, and September 1975 saw them gross $1,000,000 in two weeks on Broadway, in a triumvirate with the Count Basie Orchestra.Fitzgerald had suffered from diabetes for several years of her later life, which had led to numerous complications.[7] In 1985, Fitzgerald was hospitalized briefly for respiratory problems,[50] in 1986 for congestive heart failure,[51] and in 1990 for exhaustion.[52] In March 1990 she appeared at the Royal Albert Hall in London, England with the Count Basie Orchestra for the launch of Jazz FM, plus a gala dinner at the Grosvenor House Hotel at which she performed.[53] In 1993, she had to have both of her legs amputated below the knee due to the effects of diabetes.[54] Her eyesight was affected as well.[7]In 1996, tired of being in the hospital, she wished to spend her last days at home. Confined to a wheelchair, she spent her final days in her backyard of her Beverly Hills mansion on Whittier, with her son Ray and 12-year-old granddaughter, Alice. \"I just want to smell the air, listen to the birds and hear Alice laugh,\" she reportedly said. On her last day, she was wheeled outside one last time, and sat there for about an hour. When she was taken back in, she looked up with a soft smile on her face and said, \"I\\'m ready to go now.\" She died in her home on June 15, 1996 at the age of 79.[7] A few hours after her death, the Playboy Jazz Festival was launched at the Hollywood Bowl. In tribute, the marquee read: \"Ella We Will Miss You.\"[55] Her funeral was private,[55] and she was buried at Inglewood Park Cemetery in Los Angeles.Fitzgerald married at least twice, and there is evidence that suggests that she may have married a third time. Her first marriage was in 1941, to Benny Kornegay, a convicted drug dealer and local dockworker. The marriage was annulled in 1942.[56]Her second marriage was in December 1947, to the famous bass player Ray Brown, whom she had met while on tour with Dizzy Gillespie\\'s band a year earlier. Together they adopted a child born to Fitzgerald\\'s half-sister, Frances, whom they christened Ray Brown Jr. With Fitzgerald and Brown often busy touring and recording, the child was largely raised by his mother\\'s aunt, Virginia. Fitzgerald and Brown divorced in 1953, bowing to the various career pressures both were experiencing at the time, though they would continue to perform together.[7]In July 1957, Reuters reported that Fitzgerald had secretly married Thor Einar Larsen, a young Norwegian, in Oslo. She had even gone as far as furnishing an apartment in Oslo, but the affair was quickly forgotten when Larsen was sentenced to five months\\' hard labor in Sweden for stealing money from a young woman to whom he had previously been engaged.[57]Fitzgerald was also notoriously shy. Trumpet player Mario Bauzá, who played behind Fitzgerald in her early years with Chick Webb, remembered that \"she didn\\'t hang out much. When she got into the band, she was dedicated to her music....She was a lonely girl around New York, just kept herself to herself, for the gig.\"[36] When, later in her career, the Society of Singers named an award after her, Fitzgerald explained, \"I don\\'t want to say the wrong thing, which I always do but I think I do better when I sing.\"[16]Fitzgerald was a quiet but ardent supporter of many charities and non-profit organizations, including the American Heart Association and the City of Hope National Medical Center. In 1993, she established the Ella Fitzgerald Charitable Foundation.[58][59]The primary collections of Fitzgerald\\'s media and memorabilia reside at and are shared between the Smithsonian Institution and the US Library of Congress [60]Fitzgerald won thirteen Grammy Awards,[61] and received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1967.[62]In 1958 Fitzgerald was the first African American female to win at the inaugural show.[63]Other major awards and honors she received during her career were the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts Medal of Honor Award, National Medal of Art, first Society of Singers Lifetime Achievement Award, named \"Ella\" in her honor, Presidential Medal of Freedom, and the George and Ira Gershwin Award for Lifetime Musical Achievement, UCLA Spring Sing, and the UCLA Medal (1987).[64] Across town at the University of Southern California, she received the USC \"Magnum Opus\" Award which hangs in the office of the Ella Fitzgerald Charitable Foundation. In 1990, she received an honorary doctorate of Music from Harvard University.[65]The career history and archival material from Ella\\'s long career are housed in the Archives Center at the Smithsonian\\'s National Museum of American History, while her personal music arrangements are at the Library of Congress. Her extensive cookbook collection was donated to the Schlesinger Library at Harvard University, and her extensive collection of published sheet music was donated to UCLA.In 1997, Newport News, Virginia created a music festival with Christopher Newport University to honor Ella Fitzgerald in her birth city. Past performers at the week-long festival include: Diana Krall, Arturo Sandoval, Jean Carne, Phil Woods, Aretha Franklin, Victoria Wyndham, Charles Keating, Freda Payne, Cassandra Wilson, Ethel Ennis, David Sanborn, Jane Monheit, Dianne Reeves, Dee Dee Bridgewater, Ramsey Lewis, Patti Austin, Lalah Hathaway, Ledisi, Chrisette Michele, Natalie Cole, Freddie Jackson, Joe Harnell, Roy Ayers and Ann Hampton Callaway.Callaway, Dee Dee Bridgewater, and Patti Austin have all recorded albums in tribute to Fitzgerald. Callaway\\'s album To Ella with Love (1996) features fourteen jazz standards made popular by Fitzgerald, and the album also features the trumpeter Wynton Marsalis. Bridgewater\\'s album Dear Ella (1997) featured many musicians that were closely associated with Fitzgerald during her career, including the pianist Lou Levy, the trumpeter Benny Powell, and Fitzgerald\\'s second husband, double bassist Ray Brown. Bridgewater\\'s following album, Live at Yoshi\\'s, was recorded live on April 25, 1998, what would have been Fitzgerald\\'s 81st birthday.Austin\\'s album, For Ella (2002) features 11 songs most immediately associated with Fitzgerald, and a twelfth song, \"Hearing Ella Sing\" is Austin\\'s tribute to Fitzgerald. The album was nominated for a Grammy. In 2007, We All Love Ella, was released, a tribute album recorded for the 90th anniversary of Fitzgerald\\'s birth. It featured artists such as Michael Bublé, Natalie Cole, Chaka Khan, Gladys Knight, Diana Krall, k.d. lang, Queen Latifah, Ledisi, Dianne Reeves, Linda Ronstadt, and Lizz Wright, collating songs most readily associated with the \"First Lady of Song\". Folk singer Odetta\\'s album To Ella (1998) is dedicated to Fitzgerald, but features no songs associated with her. Her accompanist Tommy Flanagan affectionately remembered Fitzgerald on his album Lady be Good ... For Ella (1994).\"Ella, elle l\\'a\", a tribute to Fitzgerald written by Michel Berger and performed by French singer France Gall, was a hit in Europe in 1987 and 1988.[66] Fitzgerald is also referred to in the 1976 Stevie Wonder hit \"Sir Duke\" from his album Songs in the Key of Life, and the song \"I Love Being Here With You\", written by Peggy Lee and Bill Schluger. Sinatra\\'s 1986 recording of \"Mack the Knife\" from his album L.A. Is My Lady (1984) includes a homage to some of the song\\'s previous performers, including \\'Lady Ella\\' herself. She is also honored in the song \"First Lady\" by Canadian artist Nikki Yanofsky.In 2008, the Downing-Gross Cultural Arts Center in Newport News named its brand new 276-seat theater the Ella Fitzgerald Theater. The theater is located several blocks away from her birthplace on Marshall Avenue. The Grand Opening performers (October 11 and 12, 2008) were Roberta Flack and Queen Esther Marrow.In 2012, Rod Stewart performed a \"virtual duet\" with Ella Fitzgerald on his Christmas album Merry Christmas, Baby, and his television special of the same name.[67]There is a bronze sculpture of Fitzgerald in Yonkers, the city in which she grew up, created by American artist Vinnie Bagwell. It is located southeast of the main entrance to the Amtrak/Metro-North Railroad station in front of the city\\'s old trolley barn. A bust of Fitzgerald is on the campus of Chapman University in Orange, California. On January 9, 2007, the United States Postal Service announced that Fitzgerald would be honored with her own postage stamp.[45] The stamp was released in April 2007 as part of the Postal Service\\'s Black Heritage series.[68]On April 25, 2017, the centenary of her birth, UK\\'s BBC Radio 2 broadcast three programmes as part of an \"Ella at 100\" celebration: Ella Fitzgerald Night introduced by Jamie Cullum, Remembering Ella introduced by Leo Green and Ella Fitzgerald - the First Lady of Song introduced by Petula Clark.[69]', 'ErnieFreeman': 'Ernest Aaron \"Ernie\" Freeman (August 16, 1922 – May 16, 1981) was an American pianist, organist, bandleader and arranger. He was responsible for arranging many successful rhythm and blues and pop records from the 1950s to the 1970s.Freeman was born in Cleveland, Ohio. In 1935 he began playing in local Cleveland area nightclubs, and also formed a classical music trio for local social functions with his father and his sister Evelyn. Around 1939, he and Evelyn formed a new band, The Evelyn Freeman Swing Band, with fellow teenagers from Cleveland Central High School. Evelyn played piano, while Ernie played saxophone and also began writing arrangements for the band. The band began a regular engagement at the Circle Ballroom in Cleveland, and broadcast shows for WHK radio station. In 1942, most of the band, apart from Evelyn, joined the US Navy together, and became the first all-black Navy Band, called \"The Gobs Of Swing\", with Ernie as its leader.[1]After leaving the Navy in 1945 Ernie entered the Cleveland Institute of Music, from which he graduated with a BA degree. In 1946 he moved with his family to Los Angeles, to attend the University of Southern California where he received his master\\'s degree in music composition. In Los Angeles, he played in clubs, accompanying Dinah Washington and Dorothy Dandridge among others, as well as recording under his own name for the Mambo label.[2] After a spell as arranger for Woody Herman he joined the Ernie Fields Orchestra, playing the piano. Other members of the band included saxophonists Earl Bostic and Plas Johnson, guitarist René Hall, and drummer Earl Palmer. In 1951 Freeman also began playing with the Billy Hadnott Sextet, but left in 1954 to form his own combo with Johnson, Palmer and guitarist Irving Ashby. In 1955 they released their first record, \"No No Baby\" on the Middle-Tone label. They also recorded with a vocal group, the Voices, who included Bobby Byrd and Earl Nelson of the Hollywood Flames (later Bob & Earl).[1]Freeman played on numerous early rock and R&B sessions in Los Angeles, California, in the 1950s, particularly on the Specialty, Modern, and Aladdin labels, as well as for white artists such as Duane Eddy and Bobby Vee. He played piano on the Platters\\' \"The Great Pretender\" in 1955, and began releasing a number of instrumental records of his own, at first on Cash Records.[2] These included \"Jivin\\' Around\" (#5 on the R&B chart in 1956). In 1956 the Ernie Freeman Combo and the Platters appeared in Paramount Pictures\\' Rock Around The Clock introduced by Alan Freed. In the same year he was signed by Imperial Records, where he released 29 singles and seven LPs over the next seven years. His first single for the label was \"Lost Dreams\", which reached #7 on the R&B chart. His cover version of Bill Justis\\' \"Raunchy\", his biggest solo success, reached #4 on the pop chart and #1 on the R&B chart in 1957. He returned to the charts in 1958, when his version of \"Indian Love Call\" reached #58 on the Billboard pop chart.[3]In 1958 he Ernie Fields Orchestra, including Freeman, became the house band for the newly formed Rendezvous record label. In 1961, with Palmer, Johnson and René Hall, they began recording as B. Bumble and the Stingers, and Freeman played piano on their first hit, \"Bumble Boogie\" (but not their later hit, \"Nut Rocker\"). In the same year, Lew Bedell, the owner of Doré Records, suggested to him that he record a version of a Maxwell House advertising jingle.[4] The record, \"Percolator (Twist)\", was credited to Billy Joe & the Checkmates and rose to no.10 on the Billboard Hot 100 in early 1962.[5] Freeman also performed with and arranged for the Routers and their parallel group the Marketts.[1]He continued a successful session career in the 1960s, arranging and appearing on material by Frank Sinatra (\"That\\'s Life\", \"Strangers in the Night\"); Connie Francis (\"Jealous Heart\", \"Addio, mi\\' amore\"); Dean Martin (\"Everybody Loves Somebody\", \"Somewhere There\\'s a Someone\"); Johnny Mathis; and Petula Clark (\"This Is My Song\", \"For Love\"), and becoming musical director with Reprise Records. From 1960 to 1964 he arranged virtually every session for Snuff Garrett at Liberty Records including artists Julie London, Bobby Vee, Johnny Burnette, Gene McDaniels, Timi Yuro and Walter Brennan. As a footnote, \"National City\" by the Joiner Arkansas Junior High School Band charted at 53 in May 1960 was made by a group of studio musicians led by Ernie Freeman.[6] Freeman also composed music for several films, including The Cool Ones (1967), The Double Man (1967), The Pink Jungle (1968), and Duffy (1968); and arranged Carol Burnett\\'s 1972 Columbia Records album Carol Burnett Featuring If I Could Write a Song.In 1970 he contributed string arrangements to Simon and Garfunkel\\'s Bridge Over Troubled Water album before his retirement later in the decade. According to several sources, he suffered from alcoholism.[2] He died at his home in Los Angeles in 1981 from a heart attack and is buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale, California.[1]Freeman won Grammy awards for his arrangements of Frank Sinatra\\'s \"Strangers in the Night\" (1966) and Simon and Garfunkel\\'s \"Bridge Over Troubled Water\" (1970).[7]', 'FatsDomino': 'Antoine \"Fats\" Domino, Jr. (born February 26, 1928) is an American pianist and singer-songwriter of French Creole descent. Five of his records released before 1955 sold over a million copies and were certified as gold records,[1] and he had 35 records in the U.S. Top 40. His musical style is based on traditional rhythm and blues, accompanied by saxophones, bass, piano, electric guitar, and drums.[1]Domino was born and raised in New Orleans, Louisiana. The Domino family was of French Creole background. Louisiana Creole French was his first language. Antoine was born at home with the assistance of his grandmother, a midwife. His name was initially given as Anthony on his birth certificate but was later corrected.[2] His family had newly arrived in the Lower Ninth Ward from Vacherie, Louisiana.[3] His father was a well-known violinist.Domino learned to play the piano from his brother-in-law, the jazz guitarist Harrison Verrett.[1][4]Even after his success, he continued to live in his old neighborhood. His large home was roomy enough for his 13 children, but he still preferred to sleep in a hammock outside.In the summer of 1947, Billy Diamond, a New Orleans bandleader, accepted an invitation to hear the young pianist perform at a backyard barbecue. Domino played well enough that Diamond asked him to join his band, the Solid Senders, at the Hideaway Club, in New Orleans. Diamond nicknamed him \"Fats\", because Domino reminded him of the renowned pianists Fats Waller and Fats Pichon.[5]Domino attracted national attention with his first recording, \"The Fat Man\", made in late 1949 for Imperial Records, an early rock-and-roll record featuring a rolling piano and Domino vocalizing \"wah-wah\" over a strong backbeat. \"The Fat Man\" sold one million copies by 1953; it is widely considered the first rock-and-roll record to achieve this feat.[6] Domino released a series of hit songs with the producer Dave Bartholomew (also the co-writer of many of the songs), the saxophonists Herbert Hardesty and Alvin \"Red\" Tyler, the bassist Frank Fields, and the drummers Earl Palmer and Smokey Johnson. Other notable and long-standing musicians in Domino\\'s band were the saxophonists Reggie Houston, Lee Allen, and Fred Kemp, Domino\\'s trusted bandleader. Domino crossed into the pop mainstream with \"Ain\\'t That a Shame\" (1955), which reached the Top Ten. Pat Boone\\'s milder cover version reached number 1,[7] having received wider radio airplay in a racially segregated era. Domino eventually had 37 Top 40 singles.Domino\\'s debut album, Carry On Rockin, containing several of his hits and tracks that had not yet been released as singles, was issued under the Imperial imprint (catalogue number 9009) in November 1955 and was reissued as Rock and Rollin\\' with Fats Domino in 1956.[8][8] The reissue reached number 17 on the Billboard Pop Albums chart.[9]His 1956 recording of \"Blueberry Hill\", a 1940 song by Vincent Rose, Al Lewis and Larry Stock (which had previously been recorded by Gene Autry, Louis Armstrong and others), reached number 2 in the Top 40 and was number 1 on the R&B chart for 11 weeks. It was his biggest hit.[7] \"Blueberry Hill\" sold more than 5 million copies worldwide in 1956 and 1957. Domino had further hit singles between 1956 and 1959, including \"When My Dreamboat Comes Home\" (Pop number 14), \"I\\'m Walkin\\'\" (Pop number 4), \"Valley of Tears\" (Pop number 8), \"It\\'s You I Love\" (Pop number 6), \"Whole Lotta Loving\" (Pop number 6), \"I Want to Walk You Home\" (Pop number 8), and \"Be My Guest\" (Pop number 8).Domino appeared in two films released in 1956: Shake, Rattle & Rock![10] and The Girl Can\\'t Help It.[11] On December 18, 1957, his hit recording of \"The Big Beat\" was featured on Dick Clark\\'s television program, American Bandstand.On November 2, 1956, a riot broke out at Domino\\'s show in Fayetteville, North Carolina. The police resorted to using tear gas to break up the unruly crowd. Domino jumped out a window to avoid the melee; he and two members of his band were slightly injured.[12]Domino had a steady series of hits for Imperial through early 1962, including \"Walking\\' to New Orleans\" (1960, Pop number 6), co-written by Bobby Charles, and \"My Girl Josephine\" (Pop number 14) in the same year.Imperial Records was sold in early 1963, and Domino left the label: \"I stuck with them until they sold out,\" he said in 1979. In all, he recorded over 60 singles for Imperial, placing 40 songs in the top 10 on the R&B chart and 11 in the top 10 on the Pop chart. Twenty-two of Domino\\'s Imperial singles were double-sided hits.Domino moved to ABC-Paramount Records in 1963. The label dictated that he record in Nashville, Tennessee, rather than New Orleans. He was assigned a new producer (Felton Jarvis) and a new arranger (Bill Justis). Domino\\'s long-term collaboration with the producer, arranger, and frequent co-writer Dave Bartholomew, who oversaw virtually all of his Imperial hits, was seemingly at an end.Jarvis and Justis changed the Domino sound somewhat, notably by adding the backing of a countrypolitan-style vocal chorus to most of his new recordings. Perhaps as a result of this tinkering with an established formula, Domino\\'s chart career was drastically curtailed. He released 11 singles for ABC-Paramount but had only one Top 40 entry (\"Red Sails in the Sunset\", 1963). By the end of 1964 the British Invasion had changed the tastes of the record-buying public, and Domino\\'s chart run was over.Despite the lack of chart success, Domino continued to record steadily until about 1970, leaving ABC-Paramount in mid-1965 and recording for Mercury Records, Dave Bartholomew\\'s small Broadmoor label (reuniting with Bartholomew along the way), and Reprise Records. His final Top 100 single was for Reprise, a cover of the Beatles\\' \"Lady Madonna\", which peaked at number 100 in 1968.Domino appeared in the Monkees\\' television special 33⅓ Revolutions per Monkee in 1969. He continued to be popular as a performer for several decades. He made a cameo appearance in the movie Any Which Way You Can, filmed in 1979 and released in 1980, which resulted in a Country chart hit, \"Whiskey Heaven\".In the 1980s, Domino decided he would no longer leave New Orleans, having a comfortable income from royalties and a dislike of touring and claiming he could not get any food that he liked anywhere else. His induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and an invitation to perform at the White House failed to persuade him to make an exception to this policy.Domino lived in a mansion in a predominantly working-class neighborhood in the Lower Ninth Ward, where he was a familiar sight in his bright pink Cadillac automobile. He makes yearly appearances at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival and other local events. He was awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1987. His last tour was in Europe, for three weeks in 1995.[13] In 1998, President Bill Clinton awarded him the National Medal of Arts.[14] In 2004, Rolling Stone magazine ranked him number 25 on its list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\".[15]Domino\\'s large persona, dancehall piano playing, and tales of love and home made him Elvis Presley\\'s top rival. By the end of his career, Domino was credited with selling more records than any other 1950s rocker except Presley. Domino\\'s humility and shyness may be one reason his contribution to the genre has been overlooked.[16]As Hurricane Katrina approached New Orleans in August 2005, Domino chose to stay at home with his family, partly because his wife, Rosemary, was in poor health. His house was in an area that was heavily flooded.Someone thought Domino was dead and spray-painted a message on his home, \"RIP Fats. You will be missed\", which was shown in news photos. On September 1, the talent agent Al Embry announced that he had not heard from Domino since before the hurricane struck. Later that day, CNN reported that Domino had been rescued by a Coast Guard helicopter. Until then, even family members had not heard from him since before the storm.[17] Embry confirmed that Domino and his family had been rescued. The family was then taken to a shelter in Baton Rouge, after which they were picked up by JaMarcus Russell, the starting quarterback of the Louisiana State University football team, and the boyfriend of Domino\\'s granddaughter. He let the family stay in his apartment. The Washington Post reported that on September 2, they had left Russell\\'s apartment after sleeping three nights on the couch. \"We\\'ve lost everything,\" Domino said, according to the Post.[18]By January 2006, work to gut and repair Domino\\'s home and office had begun (see Reconstruction of New Orleans). In the meantime, the Domino family resided in Harvey, Louisiana.President George W. Bush made a personal visit and replaced the National Medal of Arts that President Bill Clinton had previously awarded Domino. The gold records were replaced by the RIAA and Capitol Records, which owned the Imperial Records catalogue.[19]Domino was the first artist to be announced as scheduled to perform at the 2006 Jazz & Heritage Festival. However, he was too ill to perform when scheduled and was only able to offer the audience an on-stage greeting. He released an album, Alive and Kickin\\', in early 2006 to benefit Tipitina\\'s Foundation, which supports indigent local musicians. The album consists unreleased recordings from the 1990s.On January 12, 2007, Domino was honored with OffBeat magazine\\'s Lifetime Achievement Award at the annual Best of the Beat Awards, held at the House of Blues in New Orleans. New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin declared the day \"Fats Domino Day in New Orleans\" and presented him with a signed declaration. OffBeat publisher Jan Ramsey and WWL-TV\\'s Eric Paulsen presented Domino with the Lifetime Achievement Award. An all-star musical tribute followed with an introduction by the legendary producer Cosimo Matassa. The Lil\\' Band o\\' Gold rhythm section, Warren Storm, Kenny Bill Stinson, David Egan and C. C. Adcock, anchored the band, and each contributed lead vocals, swamp pop legend Warren Storm leading off with \"Let the Four Winds Blow\" and \"The Prisoner Song\", which he proudly introduced by saying, \"Fats Domino recorded this in 1958 ... and so did I.\" The horn section included Lil\\' Band o\\' Gold\\'s Dickie Landry, the Iguanas\\' Derek Huston, and long-time Domino horn men Roger Lewis, Elliot \"Stackman\" Callier and Herb Hardesty. They were joined by Jon Cleary (who also played guitar in the rhythm section), Al \"Carnival Time\" Johnson, Irma Thomas, George Porter, Jr. (who provided a funky arrangement for \"You Keep on Knocking\"), Art Neville, Dr. John and Allen Toussaint, who wrote and debuted a song in tribute of Domino for the occasion. Though Domino did not perform, those near him recall him miming playing the piano and singing along to his own songs.Domino returned to stage on May 19, 2007, at Tipitina\\'s at New Orleans, performing to a full house. A foundation has been formed and a show is being planned for Domino and the restoration of his home, where he intends to return someday. \"I like it down there,\" he said in a February 2006 CBS News interview.[20]In September 2007, Domino was inducted into the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame. He has also been inducted into the Delta Music Museum Hall of Fame in Ferriday.In May 2009, Domino made an unexpected appearance in the audience for the Domino Effect, a concert featuring Little Richard and other artists, aimed at raising funds to help rebuild schools and playgrounds damaged by Hurricane Katrina.In October 2012, Domino was featured in season three of the television series Treme, playing himself. On August 21, 2016, Domino was inducted into the Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame. The ceremony was held in Detroit, Michigan; others that were inducted along with Domino were Dionne Warwick, Cathy Hughes, Smokey Robinson, Prince, and the Supremes.Domino was one of the biggest stars of rock and roll in the 1950s and one of the first R&B artists to gain popularity with white audiences. His biographer Rick Coleman argues that Domino\\'s records and tours with rock-and-roll shows in that decade, bringing together black and white youths in a shared appreciation of his music, was a factor in the breakdown of racial segregation in the United States.[21]Domino was also an important influence on the music of the 1960s and 1970s and was acknowledged as such by some of the top artists of that era. Elvis Presley introduced Fats at one of his Las Vegas concerts by saying \"this gentleman was a huge influence on me when I started out\". Both John Lennon and Paul McCartney recorded Domino songs. McCartney reportedly wrote the Beatles song \"Lady Madonna\" in emulation of Domino\\'s style, combining it with a nod to Humphrey Lyttelton\\'s 1956 hit \"Bad Penny Blues\". Domino returned to the \"Hot 100\" chart for the last time in 1968, with his recording of \"Lady Madonna\". That recording, as well as covers of two other songs by the Beatles, appeared on his Reprise album Fats Is Back, produced by Richard Perry and recorded by a band that included the New Orleans pianist James Booker; Domino played piano on only one track, \"I\\'m Ready.\"Domino was present in the audience of 2,200 people at Elvis Presley\\'s first concert at the Las Vegas Hilton on July 31 1969. At a press conference after the show, when a journalist referred to Presley as \"The King\", Presley gestured toward Domino, who was taking in the scene. \"No,\" Presley said, \"that\\'s the real king of rock and roll.\"[22]John Lennon covered Domino\\'s composition \"Ain\\'t That a Shame\" on his 1975 album Rock \\'n\\' Roll, his tribute to the musicians who had influenced him.The Jamaican reggae artist Yellowman covered many songs by Domino, including \"Be My Guest\" and \"Blueberry Hill\".Richard Hell, an early innovater of punk rock, covered Domino\\'s \"I Lived My Life\" with his band, the Voidoids. Jah Wobble, a post-punk bassist best known for his work with Johnny Rotten, released a solo recording of \"Blueberry Hill.\"The Jamaican ska band Justin Hinds and the Dominoes, formed in the 1960s, was named after Domino, Hinds\\'s favorite singer.In 2007, various artists came together for a tribute to Domino, recording a live session containing only his songs. Musicians performing on the album, Going Home: A Tribute to Fats Domino, included Paul McCartney, Norah Jones, Willie Nelson, Neil Young, and Elton John.[23]According to Richie Unterberger, writing for AllMusic, Domino was one of the most consistent artists of early rock music, the best-selling African-American rock-and-roll star of the 1950s, and the most popular singer of the \"classic\" New Orleans rhythm and blues style. His million-selling debut single, \"The Fat Man\" (1949), is one of many that have been cited as the first rock and roll record.[24] Robert Christgau wrote that Domino was \"the most widely liked rock and roller of the \\'50s\" and remarked on his influence:Warm and unthreatening even by the intensely congenial standards of New Orleans, he\\'s remembered with fond condescension as significantly less innovative than his uncommercial compatriots Professor Longhair and James Booker. But though his bouncy boogie-woogie piano and easy Creole gait were generically Ninth Ward, they defined a pop-friendly second-line beat that nobody knew was there before he and Dave Bartholomew created \\'The Fat Man\\' in 1949. In short, this shy, deferential, uncharismatic man invented New Orleans rock and roll.[25]Domino\\'s rhythm, accentuating the offbeat, as in the song \"Be My Guest\", was an influence on ska music.[26]https://www.facebook.com/officialFATSDominoFANSITE/https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLdjJaZ9uBnTLsE55x6S2dA (officialFATSDominoFANSITE on YouTube)https://www.myheritage.nl/site-227745721/official-fats-domino-fansite-genealogy', 'FloydDomino': \"Floyd Domino is an American musician known for his work in the genre of Western swing.Born a native of California, Domino was introduced to Western swing by way of the musicians who had migrated from Texas and Oklahoma in the 1930s and 1940s. Floyd’s close association with Western swing coincided with joining Asleep at the Wheel at the age of 19. After 7 years with Asleep at the Wheel, he is now an “AATW Alumnus” who still joins them for featured performances. While Floyd is widely recognized for his years with Asleep at the Wheel and the revival of Western swing, Floyd began his career with a broad grounding in jazz, boogie-woogie, swing and blues piano. He regularly performs as Floyd Domino Jazz Trio showcasing a unique blend of jazz and blues. Other performances include work with Willie Nelson, Merle Haggard, George Strait, The Texas Playboys, Waylon Jennings, jazz guitarist Herb Ellis, Kelly Willis, Bruce Robison, Monte Warden, Don Walser, jazz vocalist Donna Hightower, and the Crickets.In addition to a career encompassing live performances, recording (both solo and with a host of legendary performers), Floyd has contributed to promoting American roots music through his appearances at schools, camps and other learning organizations. Between his touring, recording and major performances, Floyd plays clubs, private events and contributes his talents to further roots music appreciationAppearing on over 50 top CDs plus 5 foreign releases [7]Appears on [Imports]Children's music\", 'FrancisCraig': 'Francis Craig (September 10, 1900 – November 19, 1966)[1][2] was an American songwriter and leader of a Nashville dance band. His works included \"Dynamite\" and \"Near You\".A Methodist minister\\'s son, Craig was born in Dickson, Tennessee, United States. He studied mathematics and political science at Vanderbilt University,[3] Nashville.[4] \"Dynamite!\" now the official fight song of Vanderbilt University, was written by Craig in 1922, when Craig was an undergraduate student.[5] It is played mainly at football games, basketball games, and at other Commodore sports events.While he was at Vanderbilt, Craig formed an orchestra, the Vanderbilt Jazz Band. When the university\\'s chancellor told Craig he would have to change the name of the group, disband it, or leave Vanderbilt, he dropped out and changed the orchestra\\'s name.[3]Craig had three stints on WSM radio in Nashville, Tennessee. His Francis Craig Orchestra played on the station in 1926-1928 and again in 1935-1939. He returned to the station in 1947 to work as a disc jockey on the program Featured by Francis Craig. He also worked on WGN in Chicago, Illinois, in 1940.[6]His own recording of \"Near You\" was released by Bullet Records as catalog number 1001. It first reached the Billboard Best Seller chart on August 30, 1947, and lasted 21 weeks on the chart, peaking at #1. It held the number one spot for 12 straight weeks. (A 2004 article in Billboard says that the song \"was No. 1 for 17 weeks in 1947.\")[7] It eventually sold over 2.5 million copies, and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA.[4]\"Craig\\'s version of the song was the first pop hit record ever to come out of Nashville, Tennessee.\"[8] Various recordings by other persons have followed.Other works included \"Beg Your Pardon\" with Beasley Smith.Craig died aged 66 in November 1966, in Sewanee, Tennessee.[4]', 'FrankieFord': 'Frankie Ford (August 4, 1939 – September 28, 2015), was an American rock and roll and rhythm and blues singer, best known for his 1959 hit \"Sea Cruise\".He was born in Gretna, Louisiana, as Vincent Francis Guzzo, across the Mississippi River from New Orleans, and was the adopted son of Vincent and Anna Guzzo, who named him Vincent Francis Guzzo, Jr.[1] He learned to sing and dance at an early age, and when at high school joined a group, the Syncopators, as singer and pianist. He was spotted by manager Joe Caronna, who took him to Johnny Vincent of Ace Records. Taking the stage name Frankie Ford, he made his first recordings for Ace in 1958. He toured locally in Louisiana, before recording a vocal overdub on the song \"Sea Cruise\", a song written and originally recorded by Huey \"Piano\" Smith with his group, the Clowns, and featuring overdubbed bells and ships\\' horns. As Smith already had a record in the charts, and was away touring, the record label decided to release Ford\\'s version, and it rose to #14 on the US pop chart and #11 on the R&B chart, selling over one million copies, and gaining gold disc status.[2][3]Ford toured widely around the US, but his later records were less successful, with his versions of \"Alimony\" and \"Time After Time\" only reaching the lower reaches of the national charts. He also recorded a novelty record in praise of a local TV presenter, \"Morgus the Magnificent\", with musicians including Mac Rebennack and Jerry Byrne, but it failed to sell. Ace released an LP by Ford, Let\\'s Take A Sea Cruise With Frankie Ford, before the singer moved to Imperial Records in late 1960. He recorded with producer Dave Bartholomew, and released a version of \"You Talk Too Much\", but Ford\\'s recording missed out in competition with one by Joe Jones which was issued almost simultaneously. In 1961, his version of Boyd Bennett\\'s 1955 hit \"Seventeen\" was Ford\\'s last chart entry.[2]Ford was drafted in 1962, and performed for troops in Japan, Vietnam and Korea. He later recorded occasionally for small labels, but mainly performed in clubs in and around New Orleans. He appeared in the 1978 movie American Hot Wax, and toured in Britain and Europe, recording the album New Orleans Dynamo in London in 1984. He continued to record and perform through the 1990s.[2] Ford co-owned the Briarmeade record label, which issued several singles and albums by him from the 1970s to the 2000s.[4][5] On May 16, 2010, at the Louisiana Music Homecoming in Erwinville, Ford was inducted into the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame.Ford died in Gretna at the age of 76 on September 28, 2015, following a long illness.[6][7][8][9]', 'FreddieSlack': 'Frederick Charles Slack (August 7, 1910 – August 10, 1965) was an American swing and boogie-woogie pianist and bandleader.Slack was born in La Crosse, Wisconsin.[citation needed] He learned to play drums as a boy. Later he took up the xylophone, and at the age of 13 he changed to the piano. He studied with a local teacher throughout high school. At the age of 17 he moved with his parents to Chicago, where he continued his musical training. He met Rosy McHargue, a well-known clarinetist, who took him to hear many leading musicians, including Bix Beiderbecke and Earl Hines. His first job was with Johnny Tobin at the Beach View Gardens. He later moved to Los Angeles, where he worked with Henry Halstead, Earl Burtnett and Lennie Hayton, before joining Ben Pollack in 1934.He played with the Jimmy Dorsey Band in the 1930s and was a charter member of the Will Bradley Orchestra when it formed in 1939. Known to bandmates as \"Daddy Slack,\" he played the piano solo on Bradley\\'s recording of \"Beat Me Daddy, Eight to the Bar\", one of the early white boogie-woogie hits and a classic of the Big Band era.He formed his own band in 1942 and signed with the newly founded Capitol Records. He recorded three songs at his third recording session for Capitol, on May 21, 1942. His recording of \"Cow Cow Boogie,\" sung by the 17-year-old Ella Mae Morse, was the second record Capitol issued on July 1, and by July 25 it had reached number 1 on the Hit Parade. It was Capitol\\'s first gold single.[1]T-Bone Walker was a member of Slack\\'s band from 1942 to 1944 and Slack later accompanied Walker on his first solo recording for Capitol, \"Mean Old World\".[2] This band also had a hit with \"Strange Cargo.\"Slack continued to record with Capitol until at least 1950, recording some 80 tracks for the label.[3]Slack also recorded as an accompanist for Big Joe Turner, Johnny Mercer, Margaret Whiting and Lisa Morrow.In the original version of the song \"Down the Road a Piece\", recorded in 1940 by the Will Bradley Orchestra, Slack is mentioned in the lyrics:If you wanna\\' hear some boogie then I know the place\\nIt\\'s just an old piano and a knocked-out bass.The drummer-man\\'s a guy they call 8-beat Mack\\nYou remember Doc and old \"Beat Me Daddy\" Slack.Man it\\'s better than chicken fried in bacon grease\\nCome along with me boy, it\\'s just down the road a piece.\"Eight Beat Mack\" refers to drummer Ray McKinley, and \"Doc\" refers to the band\\'s bass player, Doc Goldberg.His 1955 album Boogie Woogie on the 88 featured a horn section including jazz musicians Shorty Sherock and Herbie Harper among others, and with arrangements by Benny Carter.He also co-wrote the 1945 classic \"The House of Blue Lights\" first recorded with singer Ella Mae Morse, and later by Chuck Miller, The Andrews Sisters, Chuck Berry and Jerry Lee Lewis.', 'GeneTaylorpianist': 'Gene Taylor (born July 2, 1952, Norwalk, California, United States) is an American musicianHe began his musical training as a drummer at age eight[1] but two years later he had picked up both the guitar and his initial piano skills from boogie-woogie pianist-neighbours.[2][3] Around the age of 16 he began working with some of the big names in the West Coast blues scene including Big Joe Turner and T-Bone Walker. In the mid-seventies he joined the James Harman Band[2] and had a stint as pianist for boogie group Canned Heat between November 1974 and May 1976. From 1981 to 1984 he toured with The Blasters, and in 1986 finally recorded his first solo album, Handmade. His The Return of the Formerly Brothers, recorded with Amos Garrett and Doug Sahm in 1987, won a Juno Award the following year.From 1993 to 2007, Taylor played with The Fabulous Thunderbirds[4] amongst various other projects. He recorded an eponymous second solo album for Pacific Blues in 2003 partly accompanied by James Harman and Bill Bateman.[5] This album included a version of \"Pinetop\\'s Boogie Woogie\".Since 2007, he has been based in Belgium, playing and recording with Fried Bourbon,[6] CC Jerome\\'s Jet Setters, Dave Alvin and Jo\\' Buddy. Currently he is touring as the Gene Tayler Trio, with drummer Nico Vanhove, and the guitarist Bart De Mulder. He played at the Brussels Boogie-Woogie Festival of 2012, which took place at the Théâtre St Michel on November 24.', 'GeorgeWThomas': 'George Washington Thomas Jr. (March 9, 1883 – March 6, 1937)[1][2][3] was an American blues and jazz pianist and songwriter. He wrote several influential early boogie-woogie piano pieces including \"The New Orleans Hop Scop Blues\", \"The Fives\", and \"The Rocks\", which some believe he may have recorded himself under the name Clay Custer.George W. Thomas Jr. was the second of thirteen children born to Fanny (née Bradley) and George W. Thomas. He was born in Plum Bayou Township, just outside the Delta town of Pine Bluff, Arkansas.[2][4] In the late 1890s the family moved to Houston, Texas, where George W. Thomas Sr. became a deacon at the Shiloh Baptist Church.[2]George Jr. played piano, cornet and saxophone from an early age, and worked as a pianist in local theaters. His daughter Hociel was born in 1904; his wife died a few years later, and Hociel was largely raised by her grandmother and her aunt Beulah, later known as Sippie Wallace, who was George Jr.\\'s sister. Singer Bernice Edwards was also raised as a member of the Thomas family.[2] Around 1910, George W. Thomas Jr. formed a friendship with Clarence Williams, who was also working in the Houston theaters; they may have also met Jelly Roll Morton around this time.[3]By 1914, Williams and Thomas both began working in New Orleans, where they set up a publishing company to issue and promote compositions and arrangements by Williams and, later, Thomas. George Thomas played at parties, becoming known as \"Gut Bucket George\".[5] In 1916, he published \"The New Orleans Hop Scop Blues\", a twelve-bar blues that included \"an articulated left hand... notated using grace notes for the lower tone [which] created a pseudo boogie bass.\"[2] This is credited as one of the earliest boogie woogie piano pieces,[5] and established Thomas as a music publisher and composer.Some of his pieces were played in the Storyville area of New Orleans by his young brother Hersal Thomas, who had joined him in the city and performed with local musicians including King Oliver and his protégé Louis Armstrong.[2] Among George Thomas\\' compositions was \"Muscle Shoals Blues\", written in New Orleans but not published until later. The tune was recorded as a piano roll by James P. Johnson, and on disc by Fats Waller.[3]After his father\\'s death in 1917, Thomas became the effective head of the family. Following the closedown of the Storyville area of New Orleans,[4] he moved to Chicago in about 1921, and was joined there by his sister Beulah \"Sippie\" Wallace, who also became a performer, and by his brother Hersal, though his mother remained in Houston until her death.[2] By now the sole proprietor of his publishing company, Thomas reissued some of his earlier compositions and also played with local groups and accompanied singers, including Sippie. In all he was credited with over 100 compositions.[4]In 1922, he published \"The Fives\", co-written with brother Hersal, and inspired by a train traveling between Chicago and San Francisco. This was \"the first published boogie-woogie with a boogie bass line throughout,\" and \"helped to inspire a generation of boogie-woogie pianists\" such as Meade Lux Lewis and Albert Ammons.[2] The following year, he is widely credited with recording another of his compositions, \"The Rocks\", for Okeh Records, which contains the earliest recording of a walking bass. The recording was credited to Clay Custer, generally regarded as a pseudonym, but there is some disagreement over whether the performer was Thomas himself,[4][5] or another pianist, possibly Hersal Thomas or Harry Jentes.[2][3]In Chicago, George Thomas also recorded as an accompanist for Tiny Franklin on Gennett Records, and had his own jazz group, the Muscle Shoals Devils, who made recordings that were not released. Thomas was respected as a composer, and was quoted in the Music Trade Review in 1924:The world wants dancing music, and, tunefulness apart, wants something not reminiscent of hundreds of dances that have gone before... It is a waste of energy for the composer or publisher to plagiarize a winner. The music buying public is too wise today. And people who love to dance, even if they do not play music, are quick to appreciate novelty in melody and theme in a new song.[2]George Thomas continued to publish compositions after his brother Hersal\\'s sudden death, aged 20 in 1926, but his output diminished in the late 1920s. His last recordings were with singer Lillian Miller for Gennett in 1928.[2]Although in her later years Sippie Wallace claimed that George Thomas had died in about 1930 as a result of an accident involving a streetcar,[4] official records including his death certificate state that he died in Chicago in 1937,[1] from breaking his back falling down stairs, possibly after a fire had broken out.[3] He was buried at Restvale Cemetery in Alsip, Illinois.[2]', 'GeorgiaTomDorsey': 'Thomas Andrew Dorsey (July 1, 1899 – January 23, 1993) was known as \"the father of black gospel music\" and was at one time so closely associated with the field that songs written in the new style were sometimes known as \"dorseys\".[2] Earlier in his life he was a leading blues pianist known as Georgia Tom.As formulated by Dorsey, gospel music combines Christian praise with the rhythms of jazz and the blues. His conception also deviates from what had been, to that time, standard hymnal practice by referring explicitly to the self and its relation to faith and God, rather than the individual subsumed into the group via belief.Dorsey was born in Villa Rica, Georgia. He was the music director at Pilgrim Baptist Church in Chicago, Illinois, from 1932 until the late 1970s. His best-known composition, \"Take My Hand, Precious Lord\", was performed by Mahalia Jackson and was a favorite of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.. Another composition, \"Peace in the Valley\", was a hit for Red Foley in 1951 and has been performed by dozens of other artists, including Queen of Gospel Albertina Walker, Elvis Presley and Johnny Cash.Dorsey died in Chicago, aged 93.The Library of Congress added his album Precious Lord: New Recordings of the Great Songs of Thomas A. Dorsey (1973) to the United States National Recording Registry in 2002.Dorsey\\'s father was a minister and his mother a piano teacher. He learned to play blues piano as a young man. After studying music formally in Chicago, he became an agent for Paramount Records. In 1924, he put together a band for Ma Rainey called the Wild Cats Jazz Band. He started out playing at rent parties under the names Barrelhouse Tom and Texas Tommy, but he was.best known as Georgia Tom. For a short time around 1926, he accompanied the Pace Jubilee Singers.[3] As Georgia Tom, he teamed up with Tampa Red (Hudson Whittaker), with whom he recorded the raunchy 1928 hit record \"It\\'s Tight Like That\", a sensation, eventually selling seven million copies.[4] In all, he is credited with more than 400 blues and jazz songs. Dorsey began recording gospel music alongside blues in the mid-1920s. These recordings led to his performance at the National Baptist Convention in 1930, and he became the bandleader of two churches in the early 1930s.[5]His first wife, Nettie, who had been Rainey\\'s wardrobe mistress, died in childbirth in 1932. Two days later the child, a son, also died. In his grief, he wrote his most famous song, one of the most famous of all gospel songs, \"Precious Lord, Take My Hand.\"[6] Unhappy with the treatment received at the hands of established publishers, Dorsey founded the first black gospel music publishing company, Dorsey House of Music. He also founded a gospel choir and was a founder and the first president of the National Convention of Gospel Choirs and Choruses.He influenced not only African-American music but also music by white artists. \"Precious Lord\" was recorded by Albertina Walker, Elvis Presley, Mahalia Jackson, Aretha Franklin, B. B. King, Clara Ward, Dorothy Norwood, Jim Reeves, Roy Rogers, Tennessee Ernie Ford, and Johnny Cash, among many others. It was a favorite gospel song of the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., and was sung at the rally held at the Imani Temple the night before his assassination. By his request, it was sung at his funeral by Mahalia Jackson. It was a favorite of President Lyndon B. Johnson, who also requested that it be sung at his funeral. Dorsey was also a great influence on other Chicago-based gospel artists, such as Albertina Walker and the Caravans and Little Joey McClork.Dorsey wrote \"Peace in the Valley\" for Mahalia Jackson in 1937, which also became a gospel standard. He was the first African American elected to the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame and also the first in the Gospel Music Association\\'s Living Hall of Fame. In 2007, he was inducted as a charter member of the Gennett Records Walk of Fame in Richmond, Indiana. His papers are preserved at Fisk University. Dorsey\\'s works have proliferated beyond performance, into the hymnals of virtually all American churches and of English-speaking churches worldwide. Thomas was a member of the Omega Psi Phi fraternity. He died in Chicago, Illinois, and was interred there in the Oak Woods Cemetery.', 'HarryGibson': 'Harry \"The Hipster\" Gibson (June 27, 1915 – May 3, 1991) was a jazz pianist, singer, and songwriter.[1]Gibson played New York style stride piano and boogie woogie while singing in a wild, unrestrained style. His music career began in the late 1920s, when as the young Harry Raab, his birth name, he played stride piano in Dixieland jazz bands in Harlem. He continued to perform there throughout the 1930s, adding the barrelhouse boogie of the time to his repertoire, and was discovered by Fats Waller in 1939 and brought down to mid-town Manhattan, where he made a splash and changed his surname to Gibson.[2] Between 1939 and 1945, he played at various Manhattan jazz clubs on 52nd Street (\"Swing Street\"), most notably the Three Deuces, run by Irving Alexander,[2] and Leon and Eddies, run by Leon Enkin and Eddie Davis.In the 1940s, Gibson was known for writing unusual songs, which are considered ahead of their time. He was also known for his unique, wild singing style, his energetic and unorthodox piano styles, and his intricate mixture of hardcore, gutbucket boogie rhythms with ragtime, stride and jazz piano styles. Gibson took the boogie woogie beat of his predecessors, but he made it frantic, similar to the rock and roll music of the 1950s.[3] Examples of his wild style are found in the songs \"Riot in Boogie\" and \"Barrelhouse Boogie\". An example of his strange singing style is in the song \"The Baby and the Pup.\" Other songs that Gibson recorded were \"Handsome Harry, the Hipster\", \"I Stay Brown All Year \\'Round\", \"Get Your Juices at the Deuces\", and \"Stop That Dancin\\' Up There.\" Gibson recorded a great deal, but there are very few examples on film. However, in New York in 1944, he filmed three songs for the Soundies film jukeboxes, and he went to Hollywood in 1946 to guest star in the feature-length film musical Junior Prom.[4] Gibson preceded the first white rock and rollers by a decade, but the Soundies he recorded show significant similarities to rock and roll.[5]While working on \"Swing Street\" at night, Gibson was a fellow at the Juilliard Graduate School during the day.[6][7] At the time, Juilliard was strictly a classical music academy; Gibson excelled there, which partly explains the richness of the music he brought to the jazz world.[citation needed] The other part of the explanation is his own inventiveness, and Gibson was almost always billed and promoted as a musical genius.Unlike Mezz Mezzrow, who was white but consciously abandoned his ethnicity to adopt black music and culture as a \"white negro,\" Gibson grew up near Harlem, New York City. Gibson\\'s constant use of black jive talk was not an affectation; it was simply his uptown New York dialect. His song, \"I Stay Brown All Year Round\" is based on this.[8] In his autobiography,[2] Gibson claims he coined the term hipster some time between 1939 and 1945, when he was performing on Swing Street, and he started using \"Harry the Hipster\" as his stage name.[2]His career went into a tailspin in 1947, when his song \"Who Put the Benzedrine in Mrs. Murphy\\'s Ovaltine\" put him on the music industry blacklist.[9] His own drug use led to his decline, and with the rising popularity of young rock-and-roll musicians among teenagers in the 1950s, older musicians were not in demand. He spent time in and around Miami during the 1950s, and just before Christmas 1956 he appeared at the Ball & Chain on the same bill with Billie Holiday. In the 1960s, when Gibson saw the huge success of The Beatles, he decided to switch to rock-and-roll. By the 1970s, he was playing hard rock, blues, bop, novelty songs and a few songs that mixed ragtime with rock-and-roll; and his hipster act became a hippie act. His old records were revived by Dr. Demento, particularly \"Benzedrine\" which was included in his 1975 compilation album Dr. Demento\\'s Delights.His comeback resulted in three more albums. Harry the Hipster Digs Christmas, made of new recordings in 1974, is a home recording and is not noteworthy. Two professionally produced albums were released after this: Everybody\\'s Crazy but Me, (its title taken from the lyrics of \"Stop That Dancin\\' Up There\"), by Progressive Records in 1986, and Who Put the Benzedrine in Mrs. Murphy\\'s Ovaltine released in 1989 by Delmark Records. Those two include some jazz, blues, ragtime, and rock and roll songs about reefer, nude bathing, hippie communes, strip clubs, male chauvinists, \"rocking the 88s\", and getting hip to Shirley MacLaine.[10]Gibson may have been the only pianist of the 1930s and 1940s to go on to play in full-scale rocking blues bands in the 1970s and 1980s. Unlike his 1940s contemporaries, most of whom continued to play the same music for decades, Gibson gradually shifted gears between the 1940s and the 1970s, switching from jazz to rock. The only constant elements were his tendency to play hard-rocking boogie woogie, and his tongue-in-cheek references to drug use.In 1991, shortly before his death, Gibson\\'s family did a biographical movie short on his life and music: Boogie in Blue, published as a VHS video that year.Suffering from congestive heart failure, Gibson had long before decided that he would end life on his own terms if he ever became chronically ill. He took his own life by putting a handgun to his head on May 3, 1991.[11]', 'HenryGraymusician': 'Henry Gray (born January 19, 1925, in Kenner, Louisiana) is an African-American blues piano player and singer. He has been playing for more than seven decades and has performed with many artists, including Robert Lockwood, Jr., Billy Boy Arnold, Morris Pejoe, the Rolling Stones, Muddy Waters and Howlin\\' Wolf. He has more than 58 albums to his credit, including recordings for Chess Records. He is credited as helping to create the distinctive sound of the Chicago blues piano.[1]Shortly after he was born, Gray, an only child, moved with his parents to a farm in Alsen, Louisiana, a few miles north of Baton Rouge, where he lived during his childhood. He began studying the piano at the age of eight, taking lessons from a neighborhood woman, Mrs. White. Gray also credits the radio and music records in his home for inspiring his love of music at an early age. A few years later, he began playing piano and organ at the local Baptist church, and his family eventually acquired a piano for the house. Playing the blues was not encouraged in his family, but Henry played blues at Mrs. White\\'s house, and by the time he was 16 he was playing blues at a club in Alsen. His father initially disapproved of the job but became supportive after seeing how much money his son was making.In 1943, during World War II, Gray joined the United States Army and was sent to the South Pacific. While in the Army, he would frequently entertain other soldiers by playing the piano and singing. Shortly before the war was over, Gray was given a medical discharge from the army. He returned to the United States in 1946 and spent a brief time in Alsen before relocating to Chicago, where he had relatives, including a new baby sister, Annette, born in 1951.[2]After arriving in Chicago, Gray began spending a great deal of his time in the growing postwar jazz and blues club scene. He would spend hours listening to and trying to learn from the city\\'s best piano players and would occasionally get hired for smaller gigs. One day while he was sitting in at a club, he caught the attention of Big Maceo Merriweather, an important jazz and blues piano player in Chicago (from Detroit). Merriweather befriended Gray and had an important influence on Gray\\'s \"two-fisted playing\". He also introduced Gray to several notable bands and club owners. As a result, Gray obtained steady gigs with groups like Little Hudson\\'s Red Devil Trio (Hudson Showers) and the guitarist Morris Pejoe before moving into extensive work as a session musician in the recording studio accompanying Jimmy Reed, Bo Diddley, Billy Boy Arnold, Pejoe, and others.[3] His first recording session was in 1952 with Jimmy Rogers. Gray also worked occasionally with Little Walter, who nicknamed the young pianist \"Bird Breast.\"[4]In 1956, Gray joined Howlin\\' Wolf\\'s band and was Wolf\\'s main piano player for twelve years in performance and on recordings. Also during this time, Gray became a session player for numerous artists on recordings made by Chess Records. He recorded with many leading figures of the blues, including Abb Lock, Sonny Boy Williamson II, Homesick James, Robert Lockwood, Jr., Billy Boy Arnold, Muddy Waters, Johnny Shines, Hubert Sumlin, Lazy Lester, Little Walter Jacobs, Otis Rush, Buddy Guy, James Cotton, Little Milton Campbell, Jimmy Rogers, Jimmy Reed, and Koko Taylor.[2] Gray also made some recordings on other labels, including several with J. D. \"Jay\" Miller\\'s Louisiana Excello blues band, during the 1950s and 1960s. In 1963, Gray performed with Elmore James on the night that James died of a heart attack.[5]Gray left Wolf\\'s band in 1968 and returned to Alsen, Louisiana, due to the death of his father and to assist his mother with the family business, a fish market. Gray became an important part of Louisiana\\'s music scene. His big, rollicking sound became part of the region\\'s \"swamp blues\" style. In addition to performing, Gray worked with the East Baton Rouge Parish School Board as a roofer from 1968 to 1983.[5] In the mid-1980s he recorded a series of singles for the Sunland label, some with the harmonica player Whispering Smith, which are amongst the last great traditional blues 45-rpm records.Since the mid-1980s, Gray has performed at virtually all New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festivals, three Chicago Blues Festivals (1987, 1989, and 2005), the Montreal Jazz Festival (1988), nearly every Baton Rouge Blues Festival since its inception, the San Francisco Blues Festival, Memphis\\'s W.C. Handy Blues Festival, several times at Festival International (Lafayette, Louisiana), the Mississippi Valley Blues Festival (Davenport, Iowa), the King Biscuit Blues Festival (Helena, Arkansas), and many other festivals around the United States.Gray has traveled to Europe frequently to play at festivals and in concerts and can be heard on several European releases. In 1988, Blind Pig Records released Gray\\'s first stateside feature LP, Lucky Man. The album was produced by the guitarist Steve Freund, who also joined Gray on the album for a combination of both Chicago blues and bayou boogie. In 1990, Gray recorded the album Louisiana Swamp Blues for Wolf Records. In 1998, Gray was nominated for a Grammy Award for his album A Tribute to Howlin\\' Wolf, released by Telarc Records. That same year he played for Mick Jagger\\'s 55th birthday celebration in Paris. In the summer of 1999, Gray toured Europe with Marva Wright and her band, giving concerts of \"Louisiana music\" under the sponsorship of Blue House Records. In 2001, Gray recorded two albums: Watch Yourself, for the Lucky Cat label, and Henry Gray Plays Chicago Blues, for Hightone Records. In 2003, Henry Gray & the Cats released a CD and DVD entitled Henry Gray & the Cats: Live in Paris. Also in 2003, Gray was featured along with Ray Charles, Dr. John, Pinetop Perkins and Dave Brubeck in Clint Eastwood\\'s film Blues Piano, a part of Martin Scorsese\\'s seven-part series The Blues, which was aired on public television in the United States. Gray was awarded the 2006 National Heritage Fellowship Award by the National Endowment for the Arts, the nation\\'s top honor for folk artists.[1] In the same year, Gray was featured along with Jerry Lee Lewis, Pinetop Perkins, Marcia Ball and Little Red in a concert at Morgan Freeman\\'s club Ground Zero in Clarksdale, Mississippi, which was recorded for the DVD Falsifyin\\', produced and released by SunLion Films. That same year, Gray starred in the independent film The Glass Chord as Saul Solomon, an aging musician with Alzheimer\\'s disease.[6]Gray continues to tour as a soloist and with his band Henry Gray and the Cats. He appears in the 2015 documentary film I Am the Blues.[7]Gray has suffered from alcoholism but has been sober for many years.In 1989, his home in the Baton Rouge area was destroyed by a tornado.[4]He is married to Rivers Gray. They have three children and eight grandchildren together.[8]', 'HersalThomas': 'Hersal Thomas (September 9, 1906 – June 2, 1926)[1] was an American blues pianist and composer. He recorded a number of sides for Okeh Records in 1925 and 1926.Thomas was born in Houston, Texas, United States,[2] and displayed an early talent for blues playing and composition. He was one of several musicians in his family. His brother George Washington Thomas was also a skilled piano player and composer, while his sister Sippie Wallace and niece Hociel Thomas were singers of note.[2]Though he died at a young age, Thomas was nonetheless an influence on the Chicago boogie woogie school of pianists. Albert Ammons and Meade Lux Lewis both cited him as an influence.[2] His most famous track was \"Suitcase Blues\" (8958-A Okeh 8227), which was issued on CD in 1992 as part of the box set, Roots \\'N Blues: The Retrospective. The Thomas brothers also co-wrote \"The Fives\", which Ammons and Lewis cited as an essential boogie-woogie number.[2]Thomas recorded under his own name, and as an accompanist to Hociel Thomas, Sippie Wallace, Lilian Miller and possibly, Sodarisa Miller.[2] In 1926, he recorded a session with Hociel Thomas and Louis Armstrong.[2] The songs recorded on that occasion were \"Deep Water Blues\" (9519-A Okeh 8297), \"Lonesome Hours\" (9522-A Okeh 8297), \"Listen To Ma\" (9521-A Okeh 8346), and \"G\\'wan, I Told You\" (9520-A Okeh 8346). The first three are listed as having been composed by \"Thomas\", though it is not clear if this refers to Hersal or his brother. He also worked in session with King Oliver.Sippie Wallace recorded seven of his compositions: \"A Jealous Woman Like Me\", \"A Man For Every Day Of The Week\", \"Dead Drunk Blues\", \"Have You Ever Been Down?\", \"I Feel Good\", \"Shorty George Blues\" and \"Trouble Everywhere I Roam\".Thomas died of food poisoning while working at Penny\\'s Pleasure Inn in Detroit, Michigan. The circumstances of his death have never been clarified.[2]', 'HueyPianoSmith': 'Huey Pierce Smith,[1] known as Piano Smith (born January 26, 1934, New Orleans, Louisiana[2]), is an American rhythm-and-blues pianist whose sound was influential in the development of rock and roll.His piano playing incorporated the boogie styles of Pete Johnson, Meade Lux Lewis, and Albert Ammons, the jazz style of Jelly Roll Morton and the rhythm-and-blues style of Fats Domino.[2] AllMusic journalist Steve Huey noted that \"At the peak of his game, Smith epitomized New Orleans R&B at its most infectious and rollicking, as showcased on his classic signature tune, \\'Don\\'t You Just Know It.\\'\"[3]Smith was born in the Central City neighborhood of New Orleans. He was influenced by the innovative work of Professor Longhair.[4] He became known for his shuffling right-handed break on the piano that influenced other Southern players.[5]Smith wrote his first song on the piano, \"Robertson Street Boogie\" (named after the street where he lived), when he was eight years old. He performed the tune with a friend; they billed themselves as Slick and Dark. Smith attended McDowell High School and Xavier University of Louisiana in New Orleans.[6]When Smith was fifteen, he began working in clubs and recording with his flamboyant partner, Eddie Jones, who rose to fame as Guitar Slim.[5] When Smith was eighteen, in 1952, he signed a recording contract with Savoy Records, which released his first known single, \"You Made Me Cry\". In 1953 Smith recorded with Earl King.[7]In 1955, Smith became the piano player with Little Richard\\'s first band in sessions for Specialty Records.[3] The same year he also played piano on several studio sessions for other artists, such as Lloyd Price.[3] Two of the sessions resulted in hits for Earl King (\"Those Lonely Lonely Nights\") and Smiley Lewis (\"I Hear You Knocking\").[3]In 1957, he formed a band, Huey \"Piano\" Smith and His Clowns, with Bobby Marchan,[8] and signed a long-term contract with Ace Records, represented by former Specialty record producer Johnny Vincent. They hit the Billboard charts with several singles in succession, including \"Rockin\\' Pneumonia and the Boogie Woogie Flu\".[3]The record was issued as \"Rockin\\' Pneumonia and the Boogie Woogie Flu Part 1\" on the A-side, lyrics by John Vincent, and \"Rockin\\' Pneumonia and the Boogie Woogie Flu Part 2\", an instrumental, on the flip side. The record sold over one million copies, achieving gold disc status.[2]In 1958, Vin Records, a subsidiary of Ace Records, released a popular single, \"Little Chickee Wah Wah\", with Clowns singer Gerri Hall, under the billing of Huey and Jerry. (This song is sometimes confused with the similarly titled 1956 single \"Chickie Wah Wah\", by Bobby Marchan, which has entirely different lyrics, tempo, chord structure and melody; the Vincent-Smith composition is built around the melody of the old black children\\'s play song \"Little Sally Walker.\")Meanwhile, Ace Records released several more singles by Huey \"Piano\" Smith and His Clowns, including \"We Like Birdland\", \"Well I\\'ll Be John Brown\", and \"Don\\'t You Know Yockomo\" (a cover version of which, recorded by the New Zealand artist Dinah Lee, reached number 1 in both New Zealand and Australia in 1964).The Clowns\\' most famous single, released in 1958, was \"Don\\'t You Just Know It\" backed with \"High Blood Pressure.\" This hit number 9 on the Billboard Pop chart and number 4 on the Rhythm and Blues chart.[3] It was their second million seller.[2]In 1959, Ace Records erased Smith\\'s vocal track from \"Sea Cruise\", the now-classic single Smith had composed, arranged and performed, and replaced it with a vocal track by the white singer Frankie Ford.[3] The song was a hit for Ford.[9]Smith left Ace Records for Imperial Records, to record with Fats Domino\\'s noted producer (and fellow Louisianan) Dave Bartholomew, but the national hits did not follow.[3] Instead, Ace Records again overdubbed new vocals by Gerri Hall, Billy Roosevelt and Johnny Williams on another one of Smith\\'s unreleased tracks, to produce \"Pop-Eye\", the last hit single credited to Smith.[3]One of the vocalists for the Clowns during the late 1950s and 1960s was Curley Moore (1943–1985), who also had minor regional solo hits under his own name, including \"Don\\'t Pity Me\", recorded for SanSu Records; \"Soul Train\", on Hotline Records; and \"Get Low Down.\" in 1979, Moore joined a re-formed version of the Clowns with Smith at the 1979 New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival.[10] Moore was murdered; his body was found in Algiers, Louisiana, near New Orleans, in December 1985 . He was 42 years old.[11]In the years following, Smith made several comebacks, performing as Huey \"Piano\" Smith and His Clowns, the Hueys, the Pitter Pats, and Shindig Smith and the Soul Shakers, but he has never attained his former degree of success.[3]In 2000, Smith was honored with a Pioneer Award by the Rhythm and Blues Foundation.[12]', 'IkeTurner': 'Izear Luster \"Ike\" Turner, Jr. (November 5, 1931[1][2] – December 12, 2007) was an American musician, bandleader, songwriter, arranger, talent scout, and record producer. An early pioneer of fifties rock and roll, he is most popularly known for his work in the 1960s and 1970s with his then-wife Tina Turner in the Ike & Tina Turner Revue.Turner began playing piano and guitar when he was eight, forming his group, the Kings of Rhythm, as a teenager.[3] He employed the group as his backing band for the rest of his life. His first recording, \"Rocket 88\", credited to \"Jackie Brenston and his Delta Cats\", in 1951 is considered a contender for \"first rock and roll song\". Relocating to St. Louis, Missouri, in 1954, he built the Kings into one of the most renowned acts on the local club circuit.[4] There he met singer Anna Mae Bullock, whom he renamed Tina Turner, forming The Ike & Tina Turner Revue, which over the course of the sixties became a soul/rock crossover success.[5]Turner recorded for many of the key R&B record labels of the 1950s and 1960s, including Chess, Modern, Trumpet, Flair and Sue.[6] With the Ike & Tina Turner Revue, he graduated to larger labels Blue Thumb and United Artists. Throughout his career Turner won two Grammy Awards and was nominated for three others.[7] With his former wife, Turner was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1991 and in 2001 was inducted into the St. Louis Walk of Fame.Allegations by Tina Turner of domestic violence by Ike, published in her autobiography I, Tina and included in its film adaptation What\\'s Love Got to Do with It, coupled with his cocaine addiction, damaged Ike Turner\\'s career in the 1980s and 1990s.[8] Addicted to cocaine and crack for at least 15 years, Turner was convicted of drug offenses, serving seventeen months in prison between July 1989 and 1991.[9] He spent the rest of the 1990s free of his addiction but relapsed in 2004. Near the end of his life, he returned to live performance as a front man and, returning to his blues roots, produced two albums that were critically well received and award-winning. Turner has frequently been referred to as a \"great innovator\" of rock and roll by contemporaries such as Little Richard[10] and Johnny Otis.[11] Phil Alexander (then editor-in-chief of Mojo magazine) described Turner as \\'the cornerstone of modernday rock \\'n\\' roll\\'.[12]Turner was born in Clarksdale, Mississippi, on November 5, 1931, to Beatrice Cushenberry (1909–195?), a seamstress, and Isaiah (or Izear) Luster Turner, a Baptist minister. The younger of their two children, Turner had an elder sister named Ethel May. Turner believed that he had been named after his father, but discovered his name had been mistakenly registered as Ike Wister Turner when applying for his first passport.[14]Turner said that when he was very young he witnessed his father beaten and left for dead by a white mob. His father lived for three years as an invalid in a tent in the family\\'s yard before succumbing to his injuries.[14][15] Writer and blues historian Ted Drozdowski told a different version of the story, stating that Turner\\'s father died in an industrial accident.[16] His mother then married a man called Philip Reeves. Turner said his stepfather was a violent alcoholic and that they often argued and fought. After one fight Turner knocked out his stepfather with a piece of wood. He then ran away to Memphis, where he lived rough for a few days before returning to his mother. He reconciled with his stepfather years later, buying a house for him in the 1950s around the time Turner\\'s mother died.[17]Turner recounted how he was introduced to sex at the age of six by a middle-aged lady called Miss Boozie. Walking past her house to school, she would invite him to help feed her chickens and then take him to bed. This continued for some years. Turner claimed not to be traumatized by this, commenting that \"in those days they didn\\'t call it abuse, they called it fun\".[18] He was also raped by two other women before he was twelve.Around his eighth year Turner began frequenting the local Clarksdale radio station, WROX, located in the Alcazar Hotel in downtown Clarksdale. WROX was notable as one of the first radio stations to employ a black DJ, Early Wright, to play blues records.[19] DJ John Frisella put Turner to work. Turner described this as \"the beginning of my thing with music.\"[20] Soon he was left to play records while the DJ went across the street for coffee.[21] This led to Turner being offered a job by the station manager as the DJ on the late-afternoon shift. The job meant he had access to all the new releases. On his show he played a diverse range of music, playing Louis Jordan alongside early rockabilly records.[17]Turner was inspired to learn the piano on a visit to his friend Ernest Lane\\'s house, where he heard Pinetop Perkins playing Lane\\'s father\\'s piano. Turner persuaded his mother to pay for piano lessons; however, he did not take to the formal style of playing, instead spending the money in a pool hall, then learning boogie-woogie from Perkins. He taught himself to play guitar by playing along to old blues records.[22][23] At some point in the 1940s, Turner moved into Clarksdale\\'s Riverside Hotel, run by Mrs. Z.L. Ratliff.[24] The Riverside played host to touring musicians, including Sonny Boy Williamson II and Duke Ellington. Turner associated with many of these guests and played music with them.[16]In high school, Turner joined a local rhythm ensemble called The Tophatters who played dances around Clarksdale, Mississippi.[3] Members of the band were Clarksdale musicians and included Turner\\'s school friends Raymond Hill, Eugene Fox and Clayton Love.[25] The Tophatters played big-band arrangements from sheet music. Turner, who was trained by ear and could not sight read, would learn the pieces by listening to a version on record at home, pretending to be reading the music during rehearsals.[3] At one point, the Tophatters had over 30 members and eventually split into two,[26] with one act who wanted to carry on playing dance band jazz calling themselves \"The Dukes of Swing\" and the other, led by Turner, becoming the \"Kings of Rhythm\". Said Turner, \"We wanted to play blues, boogie-woogie and Roy Brown, Jimmy Liggins, Roy Milton.\"[3] Turner kept the name throughout his career, although it went through lineup changes over time. Their early stage performances consisted largely of covers of popular jukebox hits. B.B. King helped them to get a steady weekend gig and recommended them to Sam Phillips at Sun Studio.[27] In the 1950s, Turner\\'s group got regular airplay from live sessions on WROX-Am,[19] and KFFA radio in Helena, Arkansas.[28]Around the time he was starting out with the Kings of Rhythm, Turner and Lane became unofficial roadies for blues singer Robert Nighthawk, who often played live on WROX. The pair played drums and piano on radio sessions and supported Nighthawk at blues dates around Clarksdale. Playing with Nighthawk allowed Turner to gig regularly and build up playing experience.[29]He provided backup for Sonny Boy Williamson II, playing gigs alongside other local blues artists such as Howlin\\' Wolf, Charley Booker, Elmore James, Muddy Waters and Little Walter.[20] Performances typically lasted for about twelve hours, from early evening to dawn the next day. Turner described the scenario to an interviewer:We played juke joints; we\\'d start playing at 8.00pm and wouldn\\'t get off till 8.00am. No intermissions, no breaks. If you had to go to the restroom, well that\\'s how I learned to play drums and guitar! When one had to go, someone had to take his place.[20][30]Around this time Turner and his band recorded the song \"Rocket 88\". Jackie Brenston, a saxophonist in the Kings of Rhythm, sang lead vocals. Turner played piano on the recording, and his intro was later used nearly note-for-note by Little Richard in \"Good Golly Miss Molly\".[31] Phillips sold the recording to Chess in Chicago, who released it under the name \"Jackie Brenston and His Delta Cats\". The record sold approximately half a million copies. In Turner\\'s account book, he recorded that he was paid $20.The success of Rocket 88 caused tensions and ego clashes in the band, causing Brenston to leave to pursue a solo career, taking some of the original members with him. Turner, without a band and disappointed his hit record had not created more opportunities for him, disbanded the Kings of Rhythm for a few years.[30]After recording Rocket 88, Turner became a session musician and production assistant for Philips and the Bihari Brothers, commuting to Memphis from Clarksdale. He began by contributing piano to a B.B. King track, \"You Know I Love You\", which brought him to the attention of Modern Records\\' Joe Bihari, who requested Turner\\'s services on another King track 3 O\\'Clock Blues. It became King\\'s first hit.[4]Wishing to exploit Turner\\'s Delta music connections, Bihari contracted him as a talent scout, paying him to find southern musicians who might be worth recording.[30] Turner also wrote new material, which, unknown to him, the Bihari Brothers copyrighted under their own name. Turner estimated he \"wrote 78 hit records for the Biharis.\" Artists Turner sourced for Modern included Bobby Bland, Howlin\\' Wolf and Rosco Gordon. He played piano on sessions with them and lesser-known artists such as The Prisonaires, Ben Burton Orchestra, Little Milton, Matt Cockrell and Dennis Binder.[4]Turner was contracted to the Bihari Brothers, but he continued to work for Phillips, where he was effectively the in-house producer. This sometimes created conflicts of interest. Turner cut two Howlin\\' Wolf tracks, \"How Many More Years\" and \"Moanin\\' at Midnight,\" which Phillips sent to Chess. Turner then took Wolf across the state border, rerecorded the tracks without Phillips\\'s or Chess\\'s knowledge, and sent the results to Modern/RPM. Turner also attempted to poach Elmore James from Trumpet Records and record him for Modern. Trumpet found out and Modern had to cancel the record. However, James did eventually sign for Modern, with Turner playing piano on a James recording at Club Desire in Canton.[4][32]In 1956, Turner took a reformed version of the Kings of Rhythm north to St. Louis,[33] including Kizart, Sims, O\\'Neal, Jessie Knight, Jr. and Turner\\'s third wife, Annie Mae Wilson Turner, on piano and vocals. Turner moved over to playing guitar to accommodate Annie Mae, taking lessons from Willie Kizart to improve.[34]Turner maintained strict discipline, insisting they live in a large house with him so he could conduct early-morning rehearsals. Up until the age of 30, Turner was a teetotaler and had never taken drugs. He insisted all band members also adopt this policy and fired anyone he even suspected of breaking the rules.[35] He also fined or physically assaulted band members if they played a wrong note and controlled everything from the arrangements down to the suits the band wore onstage. Starting off playing at a club called Kingsbury\\'s in Madison, Illinois, within a year Turner had built up a full gig schedule, establishing his group as one of the most highly rated on the St. Louis club circuit, vying for popularity with their main competition, Sir John\\'s Trio featuring Chuck Berry. The bands would play all-nighters in St. Louis, then cross the river to the clubs of East St. Louis, Illinois, and continue playing until dawn. In St. Louis for the first time, Turner was exposed to a developing white teenage audience who were excited by R&B. Turner played in St. Louis clubs including Club Imperial, which was popular with white teenagers, The Dynaflow, The Moonlight Lounge, Club Riviera and West End Walter\\'s. In East St. Louis, his group played Kingsbury\\'s, Club Manhattan and The Sportsman.[34]In between live dates, Turner took the band to Cincinnati, to record for Federal in 1956 and Chicago for Cobra/Artistic in 1958 as well as fulfilling his contract as a session musician back at Sun.He befriended St. Louis R&B fan Bill Stevens, who in 1959 set up the short-lived record label Stevens financed by his father Fred. Turner released two singles on the Stevens label (#104 and #107) under the anagram, \"Icky Renrut\", as he was still under contract with Sun for several more months and did not want to cause friction with Phillips. He also contributed vocals and/or guitar on 5 additional Stevens singles: Johnny Wright (#101), Bobby Foster (#102 and #106), Chuck Wheeler (#103), and Little Cooper & The Drifters (#105). Additionally, Turner contributed vocals and/or guitar on numerous \"lost\" sessions that remained unreleased for decades. None of the Stevens singles had wide distribution when released and have since become collectible among vinyl record enthusiasts and deejays.[34]Also in 1959, Turner was charged with what he described as \"interstate transportation of forged checks and conspiracy\" and was forced to stand trial in St. Louis. At the first trial, the jury failed to reach a verdict, and at the retrial a year later, Turner was found not guilty.[36]In 1958, Turner\\'s shows at Club Manhattan were frequently visited by an eighteen-year-old high school graduate and nurse aide, Anna Mae Bullock, whose sister Aillene was a barmaid at the club and was dating a band member. After months seeing the band, Anna asked to sing with the Kings of Rhythm, finally being given the chance to do so during an intermission. Impressed by her voice, Ike Turner invited her to join the band, giving her the stage name \"Little Ann\".[5][37] Later that year, she sang background on Ike\\'s song, \"Box Top\", for Tune Town Records, and also gave birth to band member Raymond Hill\\'s son.In March 1960, Turner used Anna\\'s voice on a recording of his self-penned song \"A Fool in Love\" to lay down a guide track for a male singer who did not attend the recording. He sent the recording to Sue Records in New York, where label owner Juggy Murray insisted on putting out the track with Bullock\\'s vocal. Murray offered a $25,000 advance for the song, convinced it was a hit.[38] Around the time of the recording, Anna had been pursued by Raymond Hill to join his band and leave Turner\\'s. When Ike Turner asked her to use his last name as an attempt to discourage Hill, Anna took the offer.[39] He then changed her first name to \"Tina\", completing the name change. In July 1960, \"A Fool in Love\" was released under the billing \\'Ike & Tina Turner\\' and later became a national hit, selling a million copies and making the duo national stars. Turner added a backing girl group he renamed The Ikettes, and this also led to the first name change of the Kings of Rhythm as they began performing as The Ike & Tina Turner Revue. Robert Palmer writes, \"There was never any doubt that Tina Turner was the star... the electrifying performer audiences came to see. Ike kept his own stage presence deliberately low-key, avoiding flamboyant moves and directing the band with underplayed, economical gestures. His songwriting, production and musical direction were geared toward showcasing Tina.\"[30]The duo produced five more substantial hit singles, including \"Poor Fool\", \"I Idolize You\" and a cover of the Joe Seneca track \"It\\'s Gonna Work Out Fine\", which gave them their second million-seller and their first Grammy nomination. After the duo\\'s deal with Sue ended in 1964, Turner moved the band around to different labels, looking for the best deal and between that year and 1969 they recorded on Sonja, Warner Bros., Kent, Loma, Modern, Philles, Innis, Blue Thumb, Minit and A&M.[6] Phil Spector sought out the duo to work with on 1965\\'s \"River Deep – Mountain High\" but paid Turner $25,000 to have no creative input into the sessions. The song was not a success in the States, causing Spector\\'s retreat from the music industry, but was a big hit in Europe, reaching No. 3 in the UK singles chart.[40] This brought the duo to the attention of Mick Jagger, who in 1966 invited them to tour with and open for The Rolling Stones,[41] bringing them to a wider audience outside of soul.Other notable records the duo released were covers of Sly & the Family Stone\\'s \"I Want To Take You Higher\" and Creedence Clearwater Revival\\'s \"Proud Mary\", and the Tina Turner-penned \"Nutbush City Limits\".The success of the Ike and Tina Turner Revue gave Turner the finances to create his own recording studio, the Los Angeles-based Bolic Sounds next door to his mansion in Inglewood. The studio name was a reference to Tina\\'s maiden name, Bullock.[11] Turner had two sixteen track studios built, a large one to rent out and a smaller one for his personal recordings. He fitted them out with state-of-the-art equipment, two 24-input 16-output mixing desks custom built by John Stephens and Daniel Flickinger, IBM mix memorizers, an early Eventide digital delay.[42] The studios were opened for public hire in March 1972. Artists who recorded there included Paul McCartney, George Harrison, Duane Allman, Little Richard and Gayle McCormick.[11] Frank Zappa recorded the Ruben and the Jets album For Real! as well as most of his own Overnite Sensation and Apostrophe (\\') lps in 1973 and 1974.[43] Ike and Tina\\'s last hit, the Tina written Nutbush City Limits, was also recorded there.In 1974, Turner was arrested for using illegal blue boxes at Bolic to make long-distance phone calls. At the time of the arrest, police officers spent several hours breaking through the studio\\'s heavy security measures, as Ike worked feverishly inside trying to finish various recordings before being taken to jail. He was eventually cleared of the charges. After this the police began surveillance on the studio, believing that other illegal activities were taking place inside.[11]His partnership ended abruptly in 1976 with Tina leaving after the last in a series of violent altercations with Turner.[38]After the breakup, Turner struggled to find success as a solo artist.[44] Holly Maxwell replaced Tina Turner on Turner\\'s band from 1977 to 1985 and again for eight months in 1992. Maxwell reported a positive working relationship with Turner.[45]Turner admitted that his behavior had become increasingly erratic.[44] During the 1980s he was arrested 10 times for drug and firearm offenses and was convicted on two occasions.[46]In 1980, a SWAT team raided Bolic Sound, finding a live hand grenade and seven grams of cocaine. Turner was convicted for cocaine possession and sentenced to thirty days in the L.A. county jail with three years probation. This was Turner\\'s first conviction. In April 1981, he was arrested for shooting a 49-year-old newspaper delivery man whom he accused of being physically and verbally abusive to his then wife, Ann Thomas and of kicking his dog. Turner said he only fired a shot to scare him off and that the man had injured himself when he climbed over the fence to get away. A jury in 1982 found him not guilty of assault. By 1985, Turner\\'s finances were in disarray and he owed the state of California $12,802 in back taxes. He later settled his account. He had tried to sell Bolic Sound in 1980 to raise funds to avoid foreclosure, but the studio burned down in a fire in January 1981 on the day Turner was due to show it to a potential buyer.[11] Turner was arrested again on Friday, June 21, 1985, and charged with conspiracy to sell $16,000 worth of cocaine, possession and maintaining a residence for selling or using a controlled substance.[47] The police took $1,000 of rock cocaine from his North Hollywood apartment. Also arrested and charged with him were Eddie Coleman Jr., 32, of Altadena, a record producer, and Richard Lee Griffin, 35, of Los Angeles, a music company writer. Turner paid a $5,000 bond and was released.[48] A further arrest came in 1986 for cocaine possession, concealed carry of a handgun and traffic violations. Turner was released on $2,671 bail.[49] In January 1987, he was arrested for trying to sell 10 ounces of cocaine to an undercover police officer. He pleaded guilty to conspiring to sell the drug and not guilty to other counts.[50] On February 16, 1990, he was sentenced to four years in a California prison for cocaine possession.[51] He was incarcerated at the minimum security California Men\\'s Colony, San Luis Obispo.[46] Turner completed 18 months of his sentence before being released on parole in September 1991.[52][53] Larry Kamien, associate warden of the California Men\\'s Colony, said Turner was a model inmate.[52] In prison he became a trustee working in the library[53] and saved up $13,000 by selling cigarettes, candy bars and coffee to other inmates.[54] He played music with other inmates and wrote 15 new songs that he was planning to record when he was released.[52]In 1991, while he remained in prison, Ike and Tina Turner were inducted to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, which Spector accepted on their behalf. Released from prison, Turner said he was nervous about returning to performing, but had plans to return to the studio. He sold 20 unreleased Ike & Tina Turner recordings to independent label Esquire Records.[52] In 1993 Salt-n-Pepa sampled his Ikettes hit \"I\\'m Blue (The Gong Gong Song)\" for their 1993 single Shoop. The track went to No. 4 in the Billboard Hot 100, earning him around half a million dollars in royalties.[44] He rerecorded the song in a duet style with singer Billy Rogers. Produced by Rogers, the remake received favourable reviews.[55] He also appeared on the song \"Love Gravy\" with Rick James on the album Chef Aid: The South Park Album, the soundtrack to the TV series South Park. Ike Turner also made an appearance on MADtv in 1997, episode #2.18Turner credited Joe Louis Walker with encouraging him to return to his roots in blues music. Turner played guitar and assisted in production on Walker\\'s 1997 album Great Guitars and toured internationally with him.[56] Walker paid him $5,000 a night for six songs.[57] The positive response to the tour encouraged Turner to reform the Kings of Rhythm, taking them on a US tour in 2001. The group headlined a showcase at South by Southwest and were hailed as one of the highlights of the conference.[58] His new wife Jeanette was Ike\\'s lead singer. Turner\\'s work on the tour led to his recording and releasing the 2001 Grammy-nominated Here & Now album. In September 2003, the PBS documentary series Martin Scorsese\\'s The Blues included interviews and performances by Turner. He was featured in the episodes \"The Road to Memphis\" and \"Godfathers and Sons\".[59]In 2005, Turner revealed he had been diagnosed with emphysema and in his last years was extremely weak, having to use an oxygen tank. His daughter Mia Turner said, \"He was too weak from the emphysema to do anything. He\\'d go in the studio for a couple of minutes and play a couple of bars and say he had to go lay down.\"[60] Despite his ill health, he appeared on the Gorillaz\\' album, Demon Days, playing piano on the track \"Every Planet We Reach Is Dead\". Turner also performed the track at the live show at the Manchester Opera House from November 1–5, 2005; his performance was released on the DVD \"Demon Days: Live at the Manchester Opera House.\"[61] Before his death, a collaboration between Turner and the rock band The Black Keys, was planned by Gorillaz\\'s producer Danger Mouse in 2007. The Black Keys recorded tracks for Turner to work with.[62] Although Turner does not appear on the album (Attack & Release), Pitchfork noted his influence in the production.[63]In the year before his death he was hospitalized several times after accidentally falling. After his death in December 2007 from a cocaine overdose, Turner\\'s autopsy and toxicology report showed he was taking Seroquel at the time of his death. The medicine is most commonly used as treatment for bipolar disorder, Alzheimer\\'s disease and schizophrenia. Ex-wife Audrey Madison claims Turner was bipolar and that she was helping him with his illness, a claim supported by Turner\\'s personal assistant and caretaker, Falina Rasool. Rasool says she talked about his bipolar disorder with Turner many times and witnessed its effects:I would come in the room and see him change like a lightbulb, switch on and switch off. I did ask him about it. He said he made a song about it [\"Bi Polar\", last track on Rising With the Blues] and we started laughing... He said, \\'I know I\\'m bipolar.\\' He says, \\'And I\\'ve been bipolar, but a lot of people is bipolar.\\'However, Turner\\'s daughter Mia Turner rejected this diagnosis, saying that the medication was unnecessary: \"Daddy is not bipolar... He was so heavily medicated. He could hardly speak. He was double stepping and walking sideways.\" [64]Turner grew up playing boogie woogie piano, which he learned from Pinetop Perkins. In his professional career, he originally worked in the style of 1950s R&B, or post-jump blues. Though primarily known as a guitarist, Turner began his career playing piano and personally considered it his main instrument. He decided he was not meant to be a frontman when at 12 years old he was coerced into giving a piano recital at high school. He found the experience terrifying and from then on preferred to be in the background, controlling every aspect of the music and choreography, but not being the focus of attention. At most times in The Ike & Tina Turner Revue he played with his back to the audience.[38] Donald Fagen has written: \"[T]alented as he was, there wasn\\'t anything really supernatural about Ike\\'s skills as a musician... What Ike excelled at was leadership: conceptualization, organization, and execution.\"[65]Turner\\'s guitar style is distinguished by heavy use of the whammy bar to achieve a strong reverb-soaked vibrato, string bending, hammer-ons and triplets in his blues phrasing.[66] Turner was an early adopter of the Fender Stratocaster electric guitar, buying one from O.K. Houk\\'s Piano Co. store in Memphis the year of its release in 1954.[67] Unaware that the guitar\\'s tremolo arm could be used to subtle effect, Turner used it to play screaming, swooping and diving solos that predated artists such as Jimi Hendrix and Jeff Beck by a decade.[68] In The Stratocaster Chronicles, Tom Wheeler writes that Turner\\'s \"inventive style is a classic example of an artist discovering the Stratocaster, adapting to its features and fashioning something remarkable.\"[69] Turner himself said of his tremolo technique: \"I thought it was to make the guitar scream—people got so excited when I used that thing.\"[68] Dave Rubin wrote in Premier Guitar magazine:All those years of playing piano and arranging taught him a considerable amount about harmony, as he could certainly navigate I-IV-V chord changes. Ike modestly terms what he does on the guitar as \"tricks\", but make no mistake, he attacked his axe with the conviction of a man who knew precisely what he wanted to hear come out of it.[66]In 1951, Turner\\'s Kings of Rhythm recorded one of the first instances of use of amplifier distortion. Rocket 88 is notable amongst other things for Willie Kizart\\'s distorted guitar sound.[70] In February 2005, Fender manufactured a limited edition Ike Turner Tribute Stratocaster. The model has an alder body in Sonic Blue with an Ike Turner signature in gold ink on the body under the clear-coat, with a maple neck in a 1960s \"C\" shape with a rosewood fingerboard, with 21 vintage frets. It had three custom single coil 1960s Strat pickups. Only 100 specimens were made, retailing at $3,399.99.Robert Palmer wrote, \"perhaps he [Turner] played the behind-the-scenes Svengali too seamlessly for his own good. To the fans who bought the records and concert tickets, his contribution was practically invisible. With his creative work of the \\'50s largely forgotten and his more recent efforts overshadowed by Tina\\'s larger-than-life presence, he was easily dismissed as a purely exploitative figure riding on his wife\\'s coattails.\" However, to contemporaries and blues fans Turner\\'s contribution to music was substantial. Johnny Otis said, \"Ike Turner is a very important man in American music. The texture and flavor of R & B owe a lot to him. He defined how to put the Fender bass into that music. He was a great innovator.\"[11] B.B. King was a great admirer of Turner, describing him as \"The best bandleader I\\'ve ever seen\".[71] Turner was also a big influence on contemporary Little Richard, who said in the introduction to Turner\\'s autobiography, \"Before all these people Ike Turner was doing his thing. He is the innovator.\"[10] Richard was inspired to learn to play the piano by Rocket 88[64] and borrowed the introduction for his hit Good Golly Miss Molly.[72]Phil Alexander, editor-in-chief of Mojo magazine, has credited Turner arrangements of blues standards as being an influence on 1960s British Invasion groups: \"He proceeded to influence British rockers from the mid-1960s onwards. Without Ike you wouldn\\'t have had The Stones and Zeppelin. People like that wouldn\\'t have had the source material on which they drew.\"[12]Speaking of Turner\\'s claim to have written one of the first rock \\'n\\' roll records, broadcaster Paul Gambaccini said:In musical terms [he was] very important. Rocket 88 is one of the two records that can claim to be the first rock \\'n\\' roll record, the other being The Fat Man by Fats Domino from 1949. But Rocket 88 does have a couple of elements which the Fat Man did not. The wailing saxophone and that distorted electric guitar. It was number one in the rhythm and blues chart for five weeks, it is in the Grammy Hall of Fame and it was an indisputable claim to fame for Ike Turner ... To critics he will be known as a great founder, unfortunately to the general public he will always be known as a brutal man ... He was always on the road and he drove himself as well as punishing others.Nigel Cawthorne—coauthor of Turner\\'s autobiography—said:Although there had been black rock \\'n\\' rollers who had made it big already, they really only played to a white audience. Ike and Tina played to a mixed audience and he deliberately desegregated audiences in the southern states and he wouldn\\'t play to any segregated audiences at all. Because he had such a big band and entourage he desegregated a lot of the hotels because the hotel chains wouldn\\'t want to miss out on the money they would make from him touring the southern states.[12]Turner\\'s songs began to be sampled by hip hop artists, most notably Salt-n-Pepa sampling I\\'m Blue for use in their 1994 hit \"Shoop\"[44] and Jurassic 5 used \"Getting Nasty\" from A Black Man\\'s Soul on the 1997 track Concrete Schoolyard. Main Source also sampled \"Getting Nasty\" on track \"Snake Eyes\" as well as Ike & Tina\\'s \"Bold Soul Sister\" on \"Just Hanging Out\", both featured on their 1991 album Breaking Atoms. The track Funky Mule, also from A Black Man\\'s Soul, has been sampled extensively by jungle DJs, with the drum introduction being a very popular break. It was sampled by producer Goldie for his 1994 hit \"Inner City Life\", in the same year by Krome & Time on \"The License\", and by Paradox in 2002 on track \"Funky Mule\".[73]In Tina Turner\\'s autobiography, I, Tina, she described Ike\\'s abusive behavior. He received intense, negative publicity that was exacerbated in 1993 by the release of the film adaptation What\\'s Love Got to Do with It. The film rights to the book were acquired by Disney\\'s Touchstone Pictures. Turner stated he had mistakenly signed papers waiving the right to sue Touchstone Pictures for his depiction after accepting a $50,000 payment in exchange for the right for them to depict him in any way they saw fit.[74] Ike was played in the movie by Laurence Fishburne. Tina Turner, commenting on the historical accuracy of the film, said, \"I would have liked then to have more truth, but according to Disney, they said it\\'s impossible, the people would not have believed the truth.\"[64] Phil Spector, speaking at Ike Turner\\'s eulogy, called the film a \"piece of trash\".[75] However, Robert Palmer noted that \"Long before Tina Turner cast him as the devil incarnate ... that was Ike Turner\\'s show business persona.\"[30] In 2006, Vibe named the character of Ike Turner from What\\'s Love Got To Do With It at number 4 in their list of the 20 best movie \"bad guys\".[76]After the release of the film and Turner\\'s drug conviction, the fictionalized version of Turner from the movie was seized on by comedians, who reused it in sketches. On the 1990s sketch comedy show In Living Color, Turner was parodied by David Alan Grier. In one skit, he sang a parody of Tina\\'s song \"What\\'s Love Got to Do with It\", in which he sings proudly of his abusive personality. The video also parodies Tina\\'s video: whereas in her video Tina walks around stopping couples who are fighting, Ike walks around to couples and gives the men weapons.[77] He was portrayed on Saturday Night Live\\'s Weekend Update by Tim Meadows in a pageboy wig. This incarnation of Turner is played as desperate, making verbally derisive remarks to Kevin Nealon, later trying to win back Kevin\\'s \"love\" with gifts and a cake, and finally shoving Kevin\\'s face into the cake. On the John Boy and Billy radio show, cast member Jeff Pillars regularly performed an impersonation of Turner in a segment called \"Ax/Ask Ike\". He offered advice on interpersonal relationships, which always resulted in him giving inappropriate and humorous advice. These sketches were collected in a 2008 comedy album Ike at the Mike.[78]In 1999, Turner\\'s autobiography was published, entitled Taking Back My Name. It was written with Nigel Cawthorne with a foreword by Little Richard. In part, the memoir was a rebuttal of the public image presented of him in Tina Turner\\'s memoir and the film.Ike and Tina Turner were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1991, while Turner was in prison. Turner was nominated for a Grammy in 2001 for his album Here & Now. He was awarded with a Heroes Award from the Memphis charter of NARAS in 2004.[7]In 2006, he won his first solo Grammy in the Best Traditional Blues Album category for the album Risin\\' With the Blues, which was mixed at Future Sound Studios by Rene Van Verseveld. The album was also nominated in the 7th Annual Independent Music Awards for Blues Album of the year. Jerry D\\'Souza wrote of the album: \"Turner has it all in the palm of his hand, his phrasing breathing life into the words. He still has the power to turn the blues into an unforgettable experience.\"[79]On August 5, 2010, Ike Turner was posthumously recognized by his Mississippi hometown. Clarksdale officials and music fans gathered to unveil two markers honoring Turner and his musical legacy. The unveilings coincided with the 23rd annual Sunflower River Blues and Gospel Festival, dedicated that year to \"Rocket 88\". Turner has also been recognized with a star on the St. Louis Walk of Fame.[80]He had seven children: sons Ike III and Michael (with Lorraine Taylor), Ronald/\"Ronnie\" (with Tina Turner) and daughters Mia (with Margaret Ann Thomas), Linda Trippeter and Twanna Melby.[81] Tina\\'s son Craig (fathered by saxophonist Raymond Hill) was adopted by Turner and therefore carries the Turner name. Mia Turner was conceived and born during Ike\\'s marriage to Tina in the late 1960s. Since 2007, Ronnie is married to Afida Turner.[82]Turner was married at least eight times. He sometimes claimed to have been married 13 times. Turner\\'s first marriage was to an Edna Dean Taylor from Ruleville, Mississippi, while in his teens. He then married Rosa Lee Sane. The marriage took place in West Memphis. In 1953, he married pianist and singer Bonnie Mae Wilson, who was part of the Kings of Rhythm, but after two years she left him for another man.[3] After Bonnie, he became involved with Annie Mae Wilson, another pianist in the band, whom he married in the mid-1950s. His next marriage was to Lorraine Taylor, who had two sons with him.[83]The facts surrounding his \"marriage\" to Anna Mae Bullock (Tina Turner), including accusations of abuse, have been very publicly debated. Tina left the relationship after another violent argument on the way to a concert in 1976.[11] Their divorce was finalized in 1978.[84] In Tina\\'s autobiography, she accused Ike of violent spousal abuse.[85] In a 1985 interview, Turner admitted: \"Yeah I hit her, but I didn\\'t hit her more than the average guy beats his wife ... If she says I abused her, maybe I did.\"[11] In his 1999 autobiography, he worded this slightly differently; \"Sure, I\\'ve slapped Tina ... There have been times when I punched her to the ground without thinking. But I have never beat her.\" In a 1996 interview, Turner described his and Tina\\'s occasional actions against each other as mutually violent, saying: \"As far as abusing my family or abusing her, sure – I have slapped her, she have slapped me, we just lived normal people\\'s lives, but I guess by me having the notoriety that I have, it\\'s been totally exaggerated.\"[86]Turner claimed on more than one occasion that he had never been officially married to Bullock. In an 1985 interview with Spin Magazine, Turner stated: \"As God is my judge, of all my wives, Tina is the only one I was never legally married to.\"[11] He stated that she took his name in order to discourage a former lover from returning to her.[39] In his autobiography, Turner wrote \"We didn\\'t recognize marriages\", which Margaret Moser believes \"is true by the rural Southern standards of the times\".[20] In a 1996 radio interview, he repeated the claim that the two had never been married, and also claimed that Tina\\'s name had originally been Martha Nell (not Anna Mae) Bullock.[86]Turner married former Ikette Margaret Ann Thomas in the early 1980s.[11] In 1995, after years of courtship, he married Jeanette Bazzell. Ike and Jeanette divorced in 2001, but remained friends. In 2006, he married Audrey Madison. She divorced him, but reconciled with him before his death.[64]Turner claimed that he was first introduced to cocaine around 1960, when he was given some to try by \"two very famous people I\\'d been working with in Las Vegas at the same hotel\".[64] By 1970, Turner was heavily addicted to the drug, buying it in large quantities. He claimed that, in the early seventies, he spent $56,000 a month buying cocaine (although not all for his personal use). In a 2001 interview with Caroline Graham of The Mail on Sunday, Turner estimated that he had spent $11 million on cocaine. In 1986, he acknowledged that he had been addicted to cocaine for 15 years.[9][11][87] By 1974, his heavy usage meant he had worn a large hole through his nasal septum.[46] This hole caused him pain, which he relieved with further use of cocaine. He then began freebasing crack cocaine.[64] While in prison in 1991, Turner managed to break his dependency on cocaine. He remained clean for ten years, with the help of family members. However, in 2004, while trying to help rescue a crack addict acquaintance from his addiction, Turner entered a crack house, smelled cocaine fumes, and had a relapse.[64]In the weeks leading up to his death, Turner became reclusive. On December 10, 2007, he told personal assistant Falina Rasool that he believed he was dying and would not make it to Christmas.[64] Turner died on December 12, 2007, at the age of 76, at his home in San Marcos, California, near San Diego.[8][88] He was found dead by his former wife Ann Thomas. Rasool was also in the house and administered CPR. Turner was pronounced dead at 11:38\\xa0a.m.[64]The funeral was held on December 22, 2007, at the City of Refuge Church in Gardena, California. Among those who spoke at the funeral were Little Richard, Solomon Burke and Phil Spector. The Kings of Rhythm played versions of \"Rocket 88\" and \"Proud Mary\". Turner was cremated after the funeral service.On January 16, 2008, it was reported by the San Diego County Medical Examiner\\'s Office that Turner had died from a cocaine overdose. \"The cause of death for Ike Turner is cocaine toxicity with other significant conditions, such as hypertensive cardiovascular disease and pulmonary emphysema\", Supervising Medical Examiner Investigator Paul Parker told CNN.[89] His daughter Mia was said to be surprised at the coroner\\'s assessment, believing his advanced stage emphysema was a bigger factor.[60]On August 5, 2010, Turner was posthumously recognized by his Mississippi hometown.[90] Clarksdale officials and music fans gathered to unveil two markers on the Mississippi Blues Trail in downtown Clarksdale honoring Turner and his musical legacy.[91][92] On June 6, 2015, Turner was inducted into the Official Rhythm & Blues Music Hall of Fame in Clarksdale, Mississippi.Credited as Ike TurnerUncredited recordings:With Howlin\\' Wolf', 'JaboWilliams': 'Jabo Williams (c. 1895 – 1953 or 1954) was an African-American boogie-woogie and blues pianist and songwriter.[1] His total recorded output was a mere eight sides, which included his two best-known \"stunningly primitive\"[2] songs, \"Pratt City Blues\" and \"Jab\\'s Blues\" (1932).[1][3] Details of his life outside of music are scanty.It is generally supposed that Williams was born in Pratt City, a neighborhood of Birmingham, Alabama. However, this is based purely on references to that location in his recording of \"Pratt City Blues\".[1] He may have been named Jimmie Williams[4] and may have been born around 1895.[5] What is certain is that he relocated to St. Louis, Missouri, and was recommended to Paramount Records by Jesse Johnson, a local record store owner and talent scout.[3] In May 1932, Williams recorded eight tracks in a recording studio in Grafton, Wisconsin, for Paramount. The timing was not fortuitous, as Paramount stopped recording that year and went out of business in 1935. Consequently, Williams\\'s output was limited in both national distribution and the number of records issued.[1] His \"Kokomo Blues\" followed previous recordings in a similar style with the same refrain, but included the counting line \"One and two is three, four and five and six\".[6] This partly paved the way for the better-known song \"Sweet Home Chicago\".By the late 1940s and early 1950s, some of Williams\\'s tracks were reissued by American Music Records, amongst others. His playing style was somewhat unusual, but such belated recognition failed to unearth Williams, the details of whose life remain a mystery.[1] He was recalled briefly by Henry Townsend, who stated, \"I knew him from down on Biddle Street and I played guitar behind him around town\". He added that Williams was \"an average guy and he was very entertaining\\xa0... he disappeared from St. Louis and went down in Arkansas some place. I never knew what the hell happened to him.\"[7] According to the researchers Bob Eagle and Eric LeBlanc, Williams reportedly died in Birmingham in 1953 or 1954.[4]His total recorded output consists of the tracks \"Fat Mama Blues\", \"House Lady Blues\", \"Jab\\'s Blues\", \"Kokomo Blues\" Parts 1 and 2, \"My Woman Blues\", \"Polock Blues\", and \"Pratt City Blues\". All were included on the compilation album Boogie Woogie & Barrelhouse Piano, Vol. 1 (1928–1932), issued in 1992 by Document Records.[8]', 'JamesBooker': 'James Carroll Booker III (December 17, 1939 – November 8, 1983) was a New Orleans rhythm and blues musician born in New Orleans, Louisiana, United States. Booker\\'s unique style combined rhythm and blues with jazz standards. Musician Dr. John described Booker as \"the best black, gay, one-eyed junkie piano genius New Orleans has ever produced.\"[2] Flamboyant in personality, he was known as \"the Black Liberace\".[3][4]Booker was the son and grandson of Baptist ministers, both of whom played the piano.[3] He spent most of his childhood on the Mississippi Gulf Coast, where his father was a church pastor. Booker received a saxophone as a gift from his mother, but he was more interested in the keyboard. He played the organ in his father\\'s churches.After returning to New Orleans in his early adolescence, Booker attended the Xavier Academy Preparatory School. He learned some elements of his keyboard style from Tuts Washington and Edward Frank.[5] Booker was highly skilled in classical music and played music by Bach and Chopin, among other composers. He also mastered and memorized solos by Erroll Garner and Liberace. His performances combined elements of stride, blues, gospel and Latin piano styles.Booker made his recording debut in 1954 on the Imperial Records label, with \"Doin\\' the Hambone\" and \"Thinkin\\' \\'Bout My Baby.\" This led to some session work with Fats Domino, Smiley Lewis, and Lloyd Price.[5]In 1958, Arthur Rubinstein performed a concert in New Orleans. Afterwards, eighteen-year-old Booker was introduced to the concert pianist and played several tunes for him. Rubinstein was astonished, saying \"I could never play that ... never at that tempo\" (The Times-Picayune, 1958). During this period, Booker also became known for his flamboyant personality among his peers.[6]After recording a few other singles, he enrolled as an undergraduate in Southern University\\'s music department. In 1960, Booker\\'s \"Gonzo\" reached number 43 on the United States (U.S.) record chart of Billboard magazine and number 3 on the R&B record chart.[7] Following \"Gonzo\", Booker released some moderately successful singles. In the 1960s, he started using illicit drugs, and in 1970 served a brief sentence in Angola Prison for drug possession.[8] At the time, Professor Longhair and Ray Charles were among his important musical influences.[9]As Booker became more familiar to law enforcement in New Orleans due to his illicit drug use, he formed a relationship with District Attorney Harry Connick Sr., who was occasionally Booker\\'s legal counsel. Connick would discuss law with Booker during his visits to the Connick home and made an arrangement with the musician whereby a prison sentence would be nullified in exchange for piano lessons for Connick Sr.\\'s son Harry Connick Jr.[10][11]In 1973 Booker recorded The Lost Paramount Tapes at Paramount Studios in Hollywood, California, U.S. with members of the Dr. John band, which included John Boudreaux on drums, Jessie Hill on percussion, Alvin Robinson on guitar and vocals, Richard \"Didymus\" Washington on percussion, David Lastie on sax, and David L. Johnson on bass guitar. The album was produced by former Dr. John band member David L. Johnson and by singer/songwriter Daniel Moore. The master tapes disappeared from the Paramount Recording Studios library, but a copy of the mixes that were made around the time of the recordings was discovered in 1992, which resulted in a CD release on DJM Records.Booker then played organ in Dr. John\\'s Bonnaroo Revue touring band in 1974, and also appeared as a sideman on albums by Ringo Starr, John Mayall, The Doobie Brothers, Labelle and Maria Muldaur throughout this period.[citation needed]Booker\\'s performance at the 1975 New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival earned him a recording contract with Island Records.[9] His album with Island, Junco Partner, was produced by Joe Boyd, who had previously recorded Booker on sessions for the Muldaurs\\' records.[12] In January 1976, Booker joined the Jerry Garcia Band; however, following two Palo Alto, California, concerts that involved Garcia \"backing up ... Booker on most numbers,\"[13] Booker was replaced by Grateful Dead pianist Keith Godchaux.[citation needed]Booker recorded a number of albums while touring Europe in 1977, including New Orleans Piano Wizard: Live!, which was recorded at his performance at the \"Boogie Woogie and Ragtime Piano Contest\" in Zurich, Switzerland—the album won the Grand Prix du Disque. He also played at the Nice and Montreux Jazz Festivals in 1978 and recorded a session for the BBC during this time.[14][15] Fourteen years later, a recording entitled Let\\'s Make A Better World!—made in Leipzig during this period—became the last record to be produced in the former East Germany.In a 2013 interview, filmmaker Lily Keber, who directed a documentary on Booker, provided her perspective on Booker\\'s warm reception in European nations such as Germany and France:Well, the racism wasn\\'t there, the homophobia wasn\\'t there—as much. Even the drug use was a little more tolerated. But really I think that Booker felt he was being taken seriously in Europe, and it made him think of himself differently and improved the quality of his music. He needed the energy of the audience to feed off.[16]Keber further explained that Europeans refer to jazz as \"the art of the twentieth century\" and suggests that the \"classical tradition\" that is present in the continent led to a greater understanding of Booker among audiences. Keber states that Booker was \"concert-hall worthy\" to European jazz lovers.[16]From 1978 to 1982, Booker was the house pianist at the Maple Leaf Bar in the Carrollton neighborhood of uptown New Orleans. Recordings during this time, made by John Parsons, were released as Spiders on the Keys and Resurrection of the Bayou Maharajah.[17] Following his success in Europe, Booker was forced to adjust to a lower level of public recognition, as he performed in cafes and bars. Keber believes this shift was \"devastating\" to Booker, as he was aware of his own talent.[16]Booker\\'s last commercial recording, made in 1982, was entitled Classified and, according to producer Scott Billington, was completed in four hours.[17] By this time, Booker\\'s physical and mental condition had deteriorated. Furthermore, Booker was subject to the social stigma that affected people who used illicit drugs and who experienced mental health issues during this era of American history.[9][16]At the end of October 1983, filmmaker Jim Gabour captured Booker\\'s final concert performance for a series on the New Orleans music scene. The series, entitled Music City, was broadcast on Cox Cable and included footage from the Maple Leaf Bar in New Orleans and a six-and-a-half-minute improvisation called \"Seagram\\'s Jam.\"[18]Booker died aged 43 on November 8, 1983, while seated in a wheelchair in the emergency room at New Orleans\\' Charity Hospital, waiting to receive medical attention. The cause of death, as cited in the Orleans Parish Coroner\\'s Death Certificate, was renal failure related to chronic abuse of heroin and alcohol.[citation needed]http://www.neworleanshistorical.org/items/show/391Booker\\'s death was mourned by music lovers and numerous admirers have emerged in the time since. Harry Connick Jr., Henry Butler, and Dr. John, among others, recorded songs with titles and musical styles referencing Booker. Connick Jr. explained his mentor\\'s piano-playing style in an interview: \"Nothing was harder than that. It\\'s insane. It\\'s insanity.\" and called him \"the greatest ever.\"[18][19]Transcriptions by Joshua Paxton (with Tom McDermott and Andy Fielding) of Booker\\'s playing are available in The James Booker Collection and New Orleans Piano Legends, both published by the Hal Leonard Corporation.[citation needed] Paxton explained the significance of Booker in a 2013 interview:From a musician’s perspective or piano player’s perspective, he matters because he figured out how to do things no one had ever done before, at least in a rhythm-and-blues context.... Basically he figured out ways to do a lot of stuff at the same time and make the piano sound like an entire band. It’s Ray Charles on the level of Chopin. It’s all the soul, all the groove, and all the technique in the universe packed into one unbelievable player ... I can now say with certainty that it’s a pianistic experience unlike any other. He invented an entirely new way of playing blues and roots-based music on the piano, and it was mind-blowingly brilliant and beautiful.[18]The influential New Orleans musician, composer, and producer Allen Toussaint also praised Booker, applying the term \"genius\" to him:There are some instances in his playing that are very unusual and highly complex, but the groove is never sacrificed. Within all the romping and stomping in his music, there were complexities in it that, if one tried to emulate it, what you heard and what excited you on the surface was supported by some extreme technical acrobatics finger-wise that made his music extraordinary as far as I’m concerned. And most of all, it always felt wonderful ... He was an extraordinary musician, both soul wise and groove wise ... He was just an amazing musician.[18]Booker\\'s vocal ability is also a subject that has been covered since his death. New Orleans pianist Tom McDermott, who has also studied the work of Booker, stated that he is \"so moved\" by Booker\\'s vocals, as \"you could feel the desperation in a way that few singers could impart.\" McDermott believes that Booker skillful combination of vocal virtuosity with a magnificent emotional power superseded the singing of Frank Sinatra.[18]Patchwork: A Tribute to James Booker is a 2003 release consisting of a compilation of his songs, performed by various pianists.[17] Released in 2007, Manchester \\'77 consists of a live performance recorded in October 1977 at The Lake Side Hotel, Belle Vue, Manchester, UK, with the Norman Beaker Band in support for two songs.[20] In late 2013, Rounder Records announced the forthcoming release of a double-CD deluxe version of Classified, Booker\\'s final studio recordings.[18]Writing for PopMatters in 2014, George de Stefano said: \"And then there’s James Booker, whose stature in NOLA musical history can be gauged by the various nicknames bestowed on the gifted, troubled, openly gay musician: the Bayou Maharajah (the title of a new documentary film about the pianist), the Piano Pope, the Ivory Emperor, the Piano Prince of New Orleans. Booker himself coined at least one of these monikers—the Bronze Liberace.\"[1]A feature-length documentary about Booker Bayou Maharajah: The Tragic Genius of James Booker, directed by Keber, premiered at the SXSW festival on March 14, 2013.[21] Keber raised funds on the Kickstarter website to complete the film, as she needed to cover licensing costs to include all of the \"concert footage, home movie, funky photo and unreleased audio\" that she uncovered across the U.S. and Europe. Between December 2012 and January 2013, the Kickstarter campaign received US$18,323 from 271 backers—Keber\\'s goal was US$15,000—who responded to the director\\'s motivation: \"After so many years of simmering in obscurity, it\\'s time for James Booker to be introduced to the world!\"[22]The film documents Booker\\'s life, from his Baptist upbringing through to his solitary death at the Charity Hospital. In addition to coverage of Booker\\'s significant influence upon Connick and his collaborations with prominent artists, Keber also documents the musician\\'s heroin use and the deterioration in his mental health. In its review of the documentary, All About Jazz refers to Booker as a \"jazz genius\". As of June 2, 2013, Keber seeks a film distributor for the wider distribution of Bayou Maharajah: The Tragic Genius of James Booker, but the film will continue on the festival circuit until a deal is secured.[19] As of September 1, 2016 the film is available for streaming on Amazon.com and Netflix. The DVD release is to be expected this fall (2016) in Europe and North America.Keber\\'s film was shown in May 2013—in the \"Golden Rock Documentary\" category—at the Little Rock Film Festival that is held annually on the banks of the Arkansas River in Little Rock, Arkansas, U.S.[23] The Oxford American magazine bestowed the 2013 Best Southern Film Award to Keber at the Little Rock festival and praised the film as \"one of the most culturally important documentaries made in recent years.\" Keber explained her introduction to Booker in a subsequent Oxford American interview:When I played Booker\\'s album, the first thing that I noticed was what bizarre song titles it had—stuff like “Coquette” and “Piano Salad.” I didn\\'t know what “piano salad” meant. I had no idea what to make of the music either. I know how to listen to something like the Neville Brothers or Irma Thomas, but Booker\\'s music I didn\\'t even know how to listen to. It was like a different language.[16]In June and August 2013, the film was part of the program of the Melbourne International Film Festival (MIFF) and producer Nathaniel Kohn attended as a representative. Kohn participated in a brief interview and explained the importance of the research process:Research was key to discovering Booker and his music. He died in 1983 and many of the people who knew him are either dead or reaching that certain age when memories start to fade. So we talked to a lot of people and those conversations led to boxes of old photographs and tapes, video and music libraries in the States and in Europe, and the vaults of television stations, record companies, and museums. Over three years of research went into this production.[24]Keber\\'s documentary was also the Opening Night Film at the Southern Screen Film Festival in Lafayette, Louisiana, US on November 14, 2013. A question and answer (Q&A) session with Keber followed the screening.[25](Albums listed are with James Booker as main artist. For a complete discography which includes Booker\\'s other album credits, see \"External Links\".)', 'JamesCrutchfield': 'James Crutchfield (May 25, 1912 – December 7, 2001) was a St. Louis barrelhouse blues singer, piano player and songwriter whose career spanned seven decades. His repertoire consisted of original and classic blues and boogie-woogie and Depression-era popular songs.[1]He was called the \"King of Barrelhouse Blues\". His better-known songs include \"I Believe You Need a Shot\" and \"My Baby Cooks My Breakfast\".[2]There is no record of Crutchfield\\'s birth: \"My mama never know\\'d what day it was, she never know\\'d what month it was, but she always know\\'d what year it was. \\'Lotta folks back in them days never even know\\'d that much, but my mama always did. She told me I was born in \\'12, in Baton Rouge, when the high water was highest.\" Crutchfield said his mother, Sarah, was a \"Geechee\", a descendant of slaves of the Georgia and Carolina sea islands, and said he much resembled her. His father, Tom Crutchfield, he described as a large copper-colored man from southwestern Mississippi, whom he never met until he was eight years old and with whom he maintained a cordial relationship thereafter. An only child, James and his mother, a farm worker, migrated through Louisiana and East Texas with the cotton and sugarcane seasons, moving often and sometimes living in tents. His earliest memories were of the \"boys\" coming home from World War I and the silent-movie Westerns of William S. Hart, whom he idolized.[3]Around 1920, his mother married and settled in Bogalusa, Louisiana. In his early teens, while employed as the janitor in a theater, Crutchfield began to teach himself to play the house piano.[4] Also around this time, curious about the exact day of his birth, he went to the Baton Rouge library and told the story his mother had told him to an intrigued librarian. Together they looked through the 1912 newspapers and found that there had been a flood then, which crested on May 25. From that time on, he regarded that date as his birthday.[5]In 1927, working as an underage employee for a local railroad, Crutchfield lost his left leg below the knee in a coupling accident. The railroad settled out of court for twenty thousand dollars. Part of the money was used to buy his mother a house in Baton Rouge; the rest, with his now diminished opportunities for employment, was used to subsidize his fledgling musical career.[5]By the end of the 1920s, Crutchfield had begun traveling a rough-and-tumble circuit of Louisiana lumber camps, Mississippi levee camps[6] and East Texas juke joints,[7] performing as the M & O Kid[8] in deference to his mentor, the Mississippi barrelhouse bluesman M & O, whom Crutchfield in later years said was the best he ever heard. The establishments that served the lumber and levee camps typically stayed open all day and night and provided food, drink and lodging for two piano players, who each played a 12-hour shift for tips.[5] Competition for these jobs was cutthroat, and Crutchfield developed his lifelong habit of playing for hours without a break, out of fear that somebody better would sit down and play in his absence and steal his job (which evidently had happened).[9]Another early influence was Papa Lord God, a Texan: \"Oh Papa Lord God, he was bad, man, he was baaad!\"[5] Little Brother Montgomery showed him \"44 Blues\" when the Montgomery brothers performed in Bogalusa,[10] and he traded techniques in after-hours sessions with Champion Jack Dupree when they played at rival nightclubs on the same street in Baton Rouge, early in their careers.[5] Crutchfield worked as accompanist to Joe Pullum in the early 1930s and performed with him in Texas and Louisiana, occasionally hopping freight trains for transportation. He was to play Pullum\\'s hit \"Black Gal\" for the rest of his life. Shortly after the end of World War II, Crutchfield performed with Elmore James and Boyd Gilmore in the area around Goodman, Mississippi.[10]In 1948, Crutchfield moved to St. Louis, Missouri, a city with a venerable blues piano tradition dating back to the ragtime era.[11] He worked in the Gaslight Square entertainment district at various venues, including a decade-long residency at \"Miss Rosalee\\'s\" Left Bank.[12] In 1955, Crutchfield was appearing with Bat the Hummingbird (drums) at a bar located at 2220 Market Street (formerly Tom Turpin\\'s Rosebud Saloon), where Scott Joplin had performed half a century earlier.[13] He was found there by Paul Affeldt, on a tip from a policeman, Charlie O\\'Brien, and recorded a few days later along with Speckled Red. Several of the songs were eventually released in the anthology series Barrelhouse Blues and Stomps, on the Euphonic label. Six selections Are include on the compilation album Biddle Street Barrelhousin\\', released in 2000 by Delmark Records.[14]The decline of Gaslight Square in the late 1960s was also the decline of Crutchfield\\'s music career. He was professionally inactive in the 1970s and worked as a cook at the State Hospital for a number of years. In the early 1980s he was collecting and selling junk tires and running an illegal gambling operation.[12]In 1981, Swingmaster, a new Dutch record label, was interested in recording any of the old-time St. Louis barrelhouse piano players that were still alive. They contacted the same Charlie O\\'Brien who had been instrumental in locating Crutchfield a quarter-century earlier, and he reported that Crutchfield was still around and in fine form. Swingmaster visited St. Louis that year, but had no luck finding him. They returned in 1983, and this time, with the assistance of the bluesman Henry Townsend, they were successful. Crutchfield traveled to Groningen, Netherlands, later that year and recorded the album Original Barrelhouse Blues, which was re-released on CD in 2001 as St. Louis Blues Piano.[10] A tour included performances in Belgium, France, Germany[6] and several venues in the Netherlands, notably the concerthall Vredenburg in Utrecht, which he later said was the largest crowd he had ever played for.[10]Back in St. Louis, the local impresario Mark O\\'Shaughnessy guided Crutchfield\\'s comeback and introduced him to the contemporary blues scene.[12] He received a publicity boost when he was selected as the first recipient of the Lillian Carter Award for Outstanding Senior Citizen in 1984.[10] Crutchfield and his wife, Ernestine, moved to the Soulard neighborhood, an area known for its many nightclubs, and he played weekly at Broadway Oyster Bar, 1860 Saloon and Mike & Min\\'s, among other engagements.[5] In the late 1980s, Crutchfield was regularly performing with a backup group consisting of Guitar Frank, Papa John (washtub bass) and Rosceaux (washboard).[15] He played the 1988 St. Louis Blues Festival at the Jefferson Memorial in Forest Park,[5] appeared every weekend at Allen Avenue,[16] and began playing every Wednesday night for the next 12 years at Venice Cafe, where many of the top blues and jazz musicians in St. Louis would often sit in.[12]In the early 1990s, Crutchfield replaced the \"tub\" and \"rub-board\" with Sharon Foehner (bass) and Bill Howell (drums) and added Andy Millner (harmonica).[17] In addition to weekly engagements, one-nighters, parties and weddings, he appeared at the 1993 St. Louis Blues Festival on the riverfront,[18] Harp Attack at Mississippi Nights,[19] and the Casa Loma Ballroom.[20] A well-known and popular character around the neighborhood, his annual birthday celebration at Molly\\'s heralded the beginning of the summer beer garden season in Soulard.[12] Crutchfield performed at the 1997 St. Louis Blues Heritage Festival[21] and continued working regularly, performing with local rock-and-roll pioneer Bennie Smith and the Urban Blues Express in his last years.[15]Crutchfield died of complications of heart disease on December 7, 2001,[22] in St. Louis, almost the last bluesman of his era. An impromptu parade through the streets of Soulard was held in his honor.[12]Barrelhouse Blues and Stomps: vol. 4, various artists, Euphonic ESR-1204 (1957)Barrelhouse Blues and Stomps: vol. 5, various artists, Euphonic ESR-1205 (1967)Original Barrelhouse Blues, Swingmaster 2109 (1985)Biddle Street Barrelhousin\\', various artists, Delmark DE-739 (2000)St. Louis Blues Piano, Swingmaster CD 2205 (2001)The Story of Piano Blues: From the Country to the City, various artists, Wolf CD 120106 (2013)Another Friend Like Me, various artists, Document DOCD 32-20-19 (2013)', 'JerryLeeLewis': 'Jerry Lee Lewis (born September 29, 1935) is an American singer-songwriter, musician, and pianist, often known by his nickname, The Killer. He has been described as \"rock & roll\\'s first great wild man.\"[5]A pioneer of rock and roll and rockabilly music, Lewis made his first recordings in 1956 at Sun Records in Memphis. \"Crazy Arms\" sold 300,000 copies in the South, but it was his 1957 hit \"Whole Lotta Shakin\\' Goin\\' On\" that shot Lewis to fame worldwide. He followed this with \"Great Balls of Fire\", \"Breathless\" and \"High School Confidential\". However, Lewis\\'s rock and roll career faltered in the wake of his marriage to his 13-year-old first cousin once removed when he was 23 years old.He had minimal success in the charts following the scandal, and his popularity quickly eroded. His live performance fees plummeted from $10,000 per night to $250. In the meantime he was determined to gain back some of his popularity. In the early 1960s, he did not have much chart success, with few exceptions, such as a cover of Ray Charles\\'s \"What\\'d I Say\". His live performances at this time were increasingly wild and energetic. His 1964 live album Live at the Star Club, Hamburg is regarded by music journalists and fans as one of the wildest and greatest live rock albums ever.[6][7][8][9][10] In 1968 Lewis made a transition into country music and had hits with songs such as \"Another Place, Another Time\". This reignited his career, and throughout the late 1960s and 1970s he regularly topped the country-western charts; throughout his seven-decade career, Lewis has had 30 songs reach the top 10 on the \"Billboard Country and Western Chart\".[11] His No. 1 country hits included \"To Make Love Sweeter for You\", \"There Must Be More to Love Than This\", \"Would You Take Another Chance on Me\" and \"Me and Bobby McGee\".Lewis\\'s successes continued throughout the decade and he embraced his rock and roll past with songs such as a cover of the Big Bopper\\'s \"Chantilly Lace\" and Mack Vickery\\'s \"Rockin\\' My Life Away\". In the 21st century Lewis continues to tour around the world and still releases new albums. His album Last Man Standing is his best selling to date, with over a million copies sold worldwide. This was followed by Mean Old Man, which has received some of the best sales of Lewis\\'s career.Lewis has a dozen gold records in both rock and country. He won several Grammy awards, including a Lifetime Achievement Award. Lewis was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1986, and his pioneering contribution to the genre has been recognized by the Rockabilly Hall of Fame. He was also a member of the inaugural class inducted into the Memphis Music Hall of Fame.[12] In 1989, his life was chronicled in the movie Great Balls of Fire, starring Dennis Quaid. In 2003, Rolling Stone listed his box set All Killer, No Filler: The Anthology number 242 on their list of \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\".[13] In 2004, they ranked him number 24 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.[14] Lewis is the last surviving member of Sun Records\\' Million Dollar Quartet and the Class of \\'55 album, which also included Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins, Roy Orbison and Elvis Presley.Lewis was born to the poor family of Elmo and Mamie Lewis in Ferriday, in Concordia Parish, in eastern Louisiana, and began playing piano in his youth with two cousins, Mickey Gilley (later a popular country music singer) and Jimmy Swaggart (later a popular TV evangelist). His parents mortgaged their farm to buy him a piano. Lewis was influenced by a piano-playing older cousin, Carl McVoy (who later recorded with Bill Black\\'s Combo), the radio, and the sounds from Haney\\'s Big House, a black juke joint across the tracks.[15] On the live album By Request, More of the Greatest Live Show on Earth, Lewis is heard naming Moon Mullican as an artist who inspired him.He was also influenced by the Great American Songbook and popular country singers like Jimmie Rodgers and Hank Williams. Williams in particular struck a chord with Lewis, who told biographer Rick Bragg in 2014, \"I felt something when I listened to that man. I felt something different.\"[this quote needs a citation]His mother enrolled him in Southwest Bible Institute, in Waxahachie, Texas, so that he would be exclusively singing evangelical songs. But Lewis daringly played a boogie-woogie rendition of \"My God Is Real\" at a church assembly, which ended his association with the school the same night. Pearry Green, then president of the student body, related how during a talent show, Lewis played some \"worldly\" music. The next morning, the dean of the school called Lewis and Green into his office to expel them. Lewis said that Green should not be expelled because \"he didn\\'t know what I was going to do.\"After that incident, he went home and started playing at clubs in and around Ferriday and Natchez, Mississippi, becoming part of the burgeoning new rock and roll sound and cutting his first demo recording in 1954. He traveled to Nashville about 1955, where he played in clubs and attempted to build interest, but was turned down by the Grand Ole Opry, as he had been at the Louisiana Hayride country stage and radio show in Shreveport. Recording executives in Nashville suggested he switch to playing the guitar.In November 1956, Lewis traveled to Memphis, Tennessee, to audition for Sun Records. Label owner Sam Phillips was in Florida, but producer and engineer Jack Clement recorded Lewis\\'s rendition of Ray Price\\'s \"Crazy Arms\" and his own composition \"End of the Road\". In December 1956, Lewis began recording prolifically, as a solo artist and as a session musician for other Sun artists, including Carl Perkins and Johnny Cash. His distinctive piano playing can be heard on many tracks recorded at Sun in late 1956 and early 1957, including Carl Perkins\\'s \"Matchbox\", \"Your True Love\", \" and \"Put Your Cat Clothes On\" and Billy Lee Riley\\'s \"Flyin\\' Saucers Rock\\'n\\'Roll\". Formerly, rockabilly had rarely featured piano, but it proved an influential addition, and rockabilly artists on other labels also started working with pianists.On December 4, 1956, Elvis Presley dropped in on Phillips to pay a social visit while Perkins was in the studio cutting new tracks with Lewis backing him on piano. Johnny Cash was also there watching Perkins. The four then started an impromptu jam session, and Phillips left the tape running.[16] These recordings, almost half of which were gospel songs, have been released on CD as Million Dollar Quartet. Tracks also include Elvis Presley\\'s \"Don\\'t Be Cruel\" and \"Paralyzed\", Chuck Berry\\'s \"Brown Eyed Handsome Man\", Pat Boone\\'s \"Don\\'t Forbid Me\" and Presley doing an impersonation of Jackie Wilson (who was then with Billy Ward and the Dominoes) on \"Don\\'t Be Cruel\".Lewis\\'s own singles (on which he was billed as \"Jerry Lee Lewis and his Pumping Piano\") advanced his career as a soloist during 1957, with hits such as \"Whole Lotta Shakin\\' Goin\\' On\" and \"Great Balls of Fire\", his biggest hit, bringing him international fame, despite criticism for the songs\\' overtly sexual undertones, which prompted some radio stations to boycott them. In 2005, \"Whole Lotta Shakin\\' Goin\\' On\" was selected for permanent preservation in the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress. According to several first-hand sources, including Johnny Cash, Lewis, a devout Christian, was troubled by the sinful nature of his own material, which he believed was leading him and his audience to hell.[17] This aspect of Lewis\\'s character was depicted in Waylon Payne\\'s portrayal of Lewis in the 2005 film Walk the Line, based on Cash\\'s autobiographies.As part of his stage act, Lewis pounded the keys with his heel, kicked the piano bench aside and played standing, raking his hands up and down the keyboard for dramatic effect, sat on the keyboard and even stood on top of the instrument. Lewis told the Pop Chronicles that kicking over the bench originally happened by accident, but when it got a favorable response, he kept it in the act.[16] His first TV appearance, in which he demonstrated some of these moves, was on The Steve Allen Show on July 28, 1957, where he played \"Whole Lotta Shakin\\' Goin On\".[18][19]His dynamic performance style can be seen in films such as High School Confidential (he sang the title song from the back of a flatbed truck), and Jamboree. He has been called \"rock & roll\\'s first great wild man\" and also \"rock & roll\\'s first great eclectic\".[20] Classical composer Michael Nyman has also cited Lewis\\'s style as the progenitor of his own aesthetic.[21]Lewis\\'s turbulent personal life was hidden from the public until a May 1958 British tour where Ray Berry, a news agency reporter at London\\'s Heathrow Airport (the only journalist present), learned about Lewis\\'s third wife, Myra Gale Brown. She was Lewis\\'s first cousin once removed[22][23] and was only 13 years old at the time. (Brown, Lewis, and his management all insisted that she was 15.) Lewis was 22 years old. The publicity caused an uproar and the tour was cancelled after only three concerts.The scandal followed Lewis home to the U.S. and, as a result, he was blacklisted from radio and almost vanished from the music scene. Lewis felt betrayed by numerous people who had been his supporters. Dick Clark dropped him from his shows. Lewis even felt that Sam Phillips had sold him out when the Sun Records boss released \"The Return of Jerry Lee\", a bogus \"interview\" cut together by Jack Clement from excerpts of Lewis\\'s songs that \"answered\" the interview questions, which made light of his marital and publicity problems. Only Alan Freed stayed true to Lewis, playing his records until Freed was removed from the air because of payola allegations.Lewis was still under contract with Sun Records, and kept recording, regularly releasing singles. He had gone from $10,000 a night concerts to $250 a night spots in beer joints and small clubs. He had few friends at the time whom he felt he could trust. It was only through Kay Martin, the president of Lewis\\'s fan club, T. L. Meade (aka Franz Douskey), an occasional Memphis musician and friend of Sam Phillips, and Gary Skala, that Lewis went back to record at Sun Records.[when?]In 1960, Phillips opened a new state-of-the-art studio at 639 Madison Avenue in Memphis,[24] abandoning the old Union Avenue studio where Phillips had recorded B.B. King, Howlin\\' Wolf, Elvis Presley, Roy Orbison, Carl Perkins, Lewis, Johnny Cash and others, and also opened a studio in Nashville. It was at the latter studio that Lewis recorded his only major hit during this period, a rendition of Ray Charles\\' \"What\\'d I Say\" in 1961. In Europe, other updated versions of \"Sweet Little Sixteen\" (September 1962 UK) and \"Good Golly Miss Molly\" (March 1963) entered the hit parade. On popular EPs, \"Hang Up My Rock and Roll Shoes\", \"I\\'ve Been Twistin\\'\", \"Money\" and \"Hello Josephine\" also became turntable hits, especially in nascent discothèques. Another recording of Lewis playing an instrumental boogie arrangement of the Glenn Miller Orchestra favorite \"In the Mood\" was issued on the Phillips International label under the pseudonym \"The Hawk\", but disc jockeys quickly figured out the distinctive piano style, and this gambit failed.Lewis\\'s Sun recording contract ended in 1963 and he joined Smash Records, where he made a number of rock recordings that did not further his career. The team at Smash (a division of Mercury Records) came up with \"I\\'m on Fire\", a song that they felt would be perfect for Lewis and, as Colin Escott writes in the sleeve to the retrospective A Half Century of Hits, \"Mercury held the presses, thinking they had found Lewis\\'s comeback hit, and it might have happened if the Beatles hadn\\'t arrived in America, changing radio playlists almost overnight. Mercury didn\\'t really know what to do with Lewis after that.\" One of Smash\\'s first decisions was to record a retread of his Sun hits, Golden Hits of Jerry Lee Lewis, which may have been inspired by the continuing enthusiasm European audiences had shown for Lewis\\'s brand of rock and roll. However, none of Lewis\\'s early Smash albums, including The Return of Rock, Memphis Beat, and Soul My Way, were commercial successes.One major success during these lost years was the concert album Live at the Star Club, Hamburg, recorded with the Nashville Teens in 1964, which is considered one of the greatest live rock-and-roll albums ever.[6][8][9][10][25] In Joe Bonomo\\'s book Lost and Found, producer Siggi Loch stated that the recording setup was uncomplicated, with microphones placed as close to the instruments as possible and a stereo mike placed in the audience to capture the ambience. The results were sonically astonishing, with Bonomo observing, \"Detractors complain of the album\\'s crashing noisiness, the lack of subtlety with which Jerry Lee revisits the songs, the fact that the piano is mixed too loudly, but what is certain is that Siggi Loch on this spring evening captured something brutally honest about the Killer, about the primal and timeless center of the very best rock & roll...\" The album showcases Lewis\\'s skills as a pianist and singer, honed by relentless touring. In a 5-out-of-5-stars review, Milo Miles wrote in Rolling Stone magazine that \"Live at the Star Club, Hamburg is not an album, it\\'s a crime scene: Jerry Lee Lewis slaughters his rivals in a thirteen-song set that feels like one long convulsion.\" Unfortunately, due to legal constraints, the album was not released in the United States.Frustrated by Smash\\'s inability to score a hit, Lewis was nearing the end of his contract when promotions manager Eddie Kilroy called him and pitched the idea of cutting a pure country record in Nashville. With nothing to lose, Lewis agreed to record the Jerry Chestnut song \"Another Place, Another Time\", which was released as a single on March 9, 1968, and, to everyone\\'s amazement, shot up the country charts. At the time of the release, Lewis had been playing Iago in a rock and roll adaptation of Othello called Catch My Soul in Los Angeles but was soon rushed back to Nashville to record another batch of songs with producer Jerry Kennedy. What followed was a string of hits that no one could have ever predicted, although country music had remained a major part of Lewis\\'s repertoire. As Colin Escott observes in the sleeve to the 1995 compilation Killer Country, the conversion to country music in 1968 \"looked at the time like a radical shift, but it was neither as abrupt nor as unexpected as it seemed. Jerry had always recorded country music, and his country breakthrough \\'Another Place, Another Time\\' had been preceded by many, many country records starting with his first, \\'Crazy Arms\\', in 1956.\" The last time Lewis had a song on the country charts was with \"Pen And Paper\" in 1964, which had reached number 36, but \"Another Place, Another Time\" would go all the way to number 4 and remain on the charts for 17 weeks.Between 1968 and 1977, Lewis had 17 Top 10 hit singles on the Billboard country chart, including four chart toppers. Hits include \"What\\'s Made Milwaukee Famous (Has Made A Loser Out of Me)\", \"To Make Love Sweeter For You\", \"She Still Comes Around (To Love What\\'s Left of Me)\", \"Since I Met You Baby\", \"Once More With Feeling\", \"One Has My Name (The Other Has My Heart)\", and \"Sometimes A Memory Ain\\'t Enough\". The production on his early country albums, such as Another Place, Another Time and She Even Woke Me Up To Say Goodbye, was sparse, quite different from the slick \"Nashville sound\" that was predominant on country radio at the time, and also expressed a full commitment by Lewis to a country audience. The songs still featured Lewis\\'s inimitable piano flourishes, but critics were most taken aback by the rock and roll pioneer\\'s effortlessly soulful vocals, which possessed an emotional resonance on par with the most respected country singers of the time, such as George Jones and Merle Haggard. In his book Jerry Lee Lewis: His Own Story, biographer Rick Bragg notes that the songs Lewis was recording \"were of the kind they were starting to call \\'hard country\\', not because it had a rock beat or crossed over into rock in a real way, but because it was more substantial than the cloying, overproduced mess out there on country radio\".In a remarkable turnaround, Lewis became the most bankable country star in the world. He was so hot in 1970 that his former Smash producer Shelby Singleton, who purchased Sun Records from Sam Phillips in July 1969, wasted no time in repackaging many of Lewis\\'s old country recordings with such effectiveness that many fans assumed they were recent releases. One of his latter unreleased Sun recordings, \"One Minute Past Eternity,\" was issued as a single and soared to number 2 on the country chart, following Lewis\\'s recent Mercury hit \"She Even Woke Me Up To Say Goodbye.\" Singleton would milk these unreleased recordings for years, following The Golden Cream of the Country with A Taste of Country later in 1970.Lewis played the Grand Ole Opry for the first time on January 20, 1973. As Colin Escott writes in the liner notes to A Half Century of Hits, Lewis had always maintained ambivalent feelings towards Music City ever since he\\'d been turned away as an aspiring musician before his glory days at Sun Records: \"It was 18 years since he had left Nashville broke and disheartened...Lewis was never truly accepted in Nashville. He didn\\'t move there and didn\\'t schmooze there. He didn\\'t fit in with the family values crowd. Lewis family values weren\\'t necessarily worse, but they were different.\" When Lewis finally took the stage, he broke just about every rule the Opry had. As recounted in a 2015 online Rolling Stone article by Beville Dunkerly, Lewis opened with his comeback single \"Another Place, Another Time\" and then announced to the audience, \"Let me tell ya something about Jerry Lee Lewis, ladies and gentlemen: I am a rock and rollin\\', country-and-western, rhythm and blues-singin\\' motherfucker!\" Ignoring his allotted time constraints – and, thus, commercial breaks – Lewis played for 40 minutes (the average Opry performance is two songs, for about eight maximum minutes of stage time) and invited Del Wood – the one member of the Opry who had been kind to him when he had been there as a teenager – out on stage to sing with him. He also blasted through \"Whole Lotta Shakin\\' Going On\", \"Workin\\' Man Blues\", \"Good Golly Miss Molly\", and a host of others classics before leaving the stage to a thunderous standing ovation.Lewis returned to the pop charts with \"Me and Bobby McGee\" in 1971 and \"Chantilly Lace\" in 1972, and this turn of events, coupled with a revitalized public interest in vintage rock and roll, inspired Mercury to fly Lewis to London in 1973 to record with a cadre of gifted British and Irish musicians, including Rory Gallagher, Kenney Jones, and Albert Lee. By all accounts the sessions were tense. The remake of Lewis\\'s old Sun cut \"Drinking Wine Spo-Dee-O-Dee\" would be the album\\'s hit single, reaching number 20 on the Billboard country chart and peaking at number 41 on the pop chart. The Session would be Lewis\\'s highest pop charting album since 1964\\'s Golden Hits of Jerry Lee Lewis, hitting number 37. It did far better on the country albums chart, rising to number 4. Later that same year, he went to Memphis and recorded Southern Roots: Back Home to Memphis, a soul-infused rock album produced by Huey Meaux. According to Rick Bragg\\'s authorized 2014 biography, \"the Killer\" was in a foul mood when he showed up at Trans Maximus Studios in Memphis to record: \"During these sessions, he insulted the producer, threatened to kill a photographer, and drank and medicated his way into but not out of a fog.\" During one exchange that can be heard on the 2013 reissue Southern Roots: The Original Sessions, Meaux asks Lewis, \"Do you wanna try one?\", meaning a take, to which Lewis replies \"If you got enough fuckin\\' sense to cut it.\" Lewis was still pumping out country albums, although the hits were beginning to dry up. His last big hit with Mercury was \"Middle Age Crazy,\" which made it to number 4 in 1977.In 1979, Lewis switched to Elektra and produced the critically acclaimed Jerry Lee Lewis, although sales were disappointing. In 1986, Lewis was one of the inaugural inductees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Although looking frail after several hospitalizations due to stomach problems, Lewis was responsible for beginning an unplanned jam at the end of the evening, which was immediately incorporated into the event. That year, he returned to Sun Studio in Memphis to team up with Orbison, Cash, and Perkins along with longtime admirers like John Fogerty to create the album Class of \\'55, a sort of followup to the Million Dollar Quartet session, though in the eyes of many critics and fans, lacking the spirit of the old days at Sun. In 1989, a major motion picture based on his early life in rock & roll, Great Balls of Fire!, brought him back into the public eye, especially when he decided to re-record all his songs for the movie soundtrack. The film was based on the book by Lewis\\'s ex-wife, Myra Gale Lewis, and starred Dennis Quaid as Lewis, Winona Ryder as Myra, and Alec Baldwin as Jimmy Swaggart. The movie focuses on Lewis\\'s early career and his relationship with Myra, and ends with the scandal of the late 1950s. A year later, in 1990, Lewis made minor news when a new song he co-wrote called \"It Was the Whiskey Talkin\\' (Not Me)\" was included in the soundtrack to the hit movie Dick Tracy. The song is also heard in the movie, playing on a radio. The public downfall of his cousin, television evangelist Jimmy Swaggart, resulted in more adverse publicity to a troubled family. Swaggart is also a piano player, as is another cousin, country music star Mickey Gilley. All three listened to the same music in their youth, and frequented Haney\\'s Big House, the Ferriday club that featured black blues acts. Lewis and Swaggart have had a complex relationship over the years.In 1998, he toured Europe with Chuck Berry and Little Richard. On February 12, 2005, he was given a Lifetime Achievement Award by The Recording Academy (which also grants the Grammy Awards). On September 26, 2006, a new album titled Last Man Standing was released, featuring many of rock and roll\\'s elite as guest stars. Receiving positive reviews, the album charted in four different Billboard charts, including a two-week stay at number one on the Indie charts. A DVD entitled Last Man Standing Live, featuring concert footage with many guest artists, was released in March 2007, and the CD achieved Lewis\\'s 10th official gold disk for selling over half-a-million copies in the US alone. \\'Last Man Standing\\' is Lewis\\'s biggest selling album of all time. It features contributions from Little Richard, Mick Jagger, Willie Nelson, Jimmy Page, Keith Richards and Rod Stewart, among others. Lewis now lives on a ranch in Nesbit, Mississippi, with his family.[26][27][28] In May 2013, Lewis opened a new club on Beale Street in Memphis. As of early 2016, Jerry Lee is still actively performing in concert.[29]Along with Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins and Roy Orbison, Lewis received a Grammy in the spoken-word category for the very rare album of interviews released with some early copies of the Class of \\'55 album in 1986. The original Sun cut of \"Great Balls of Fire\" was elected to the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1998, and Lewis\\'s Sun recording of \"Whole Lotta Shakin\\' Goin On\" received this honor in 1999. Only recordings which are at least 25 years old and have left a lasting impression can receive this honor. On February 12, 2005, Lewis received the Recording Academy\\'s Lifetime Achievement Award the day before the Recording Academy\\'s main Grammy Awards ceremony, which he also attended.In June 1989, Lewis was honored for his contribution to the recording industry with a star along Hollywood Boulevard on the Hollywood Walk of Fame . Between 1957 and 2006, the date of Last Man Standing\\'s release, 47 singles and 22 albums (The Session counted as 2 albums) made the Top Twenty Pop, Jukebox, Rock, Indie and/or Country charts in the US or the UK. Fourteen[clarification needed] reached the number-1 position. He has had ten official gold discs, the latest being for the 2006 album Last Man Standing, plus unofficial ones issued by his record company Mercury for albums which sold over a quarter of a million copies. His 2006 duets CD Last Man Standing has sold over half a million worldwide, his biggest selling album ever. Lewis is also among the Top 50 all-time Billboard Country artists. It is also rumored that the soundtrack album to the movie Great Balls of Fire has now sold over a million copies. On October 10, 2007, Lewis received the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame\\'s American Music Masters Award. His newest album, Mean Old Man, was released in September 2010 and reached No. 30 on the Billboard 200 album chart. On November 5, 2007, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, honored Lewis with six days of conferences, interviews, a DVD premiere and film clips, dedicated to him and entitled The Life And Music of Jerry Lee Lewis.[citation needed] On November 10, the week culminated with a tribute concert compered by Kris Kristofferson. Lewis was present to accept the American Music Masters Award and closed his own tribute show with a rendition of \"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\" On February 10, 2008, he appeared with John Fogerty and Little Richard on the 50th Grammy Awards Show, performing \"Great Balls of Fire\" in a medley with \"Good Golly Miss Molly\". On June 4, 2008, Lewis was inducted into The Louisiana Music Hall of Fame and appeared on A Capitol Fourth and performed the finale\\'s final act with a medley of \"Roll Over Beethoven\", \"Whole Lotta Shakin\\' Goin On\" and \"Great Balls of Fire.\" In October 2008, as part of a very successful European tour, Lewis returned to the UK, almost exactly 50 years after his ill-fated first tour. He appeared at two London shows: a special private show at the 100 Club on October 25 and at the London Forum on October 28 with Wanda Jackson and his sister, Linda Gail Lewis.[30] 2009 marked the sixtieth year since Lewis\\'s first public performance when he performed \"Drinking Wine Spo-Dee-O-Dee\" at a car dealership on November 19, 1949, in Ferriday, Louisiana.[citation needed]. In August 2009, in advance of his new album, a single entitled \"Mean old man\" was released for download. It was written by Kris Kristofferson. An EP featuring this song and four more was also released on November 11. On October 29, 2009, Lewis opened the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 25th Anniversary concert at Madison Square Garden in New York.Lewis has been married seven times:[31] His first marriage, to Dorothy Barton, lasted for 20 months, from February 1952 to October 1953.[32] His second marriage, to Jane Mitchum, was of dubious validity because it occurred 23 days before his divorce from Barton was final. It lasted for four years, from September 1953 to October 1957. The couple had two children: Jerry Lee Lewis Jr. (1954–1973) and Ronnie Guy Lewis (b. 1956). His third marriage, to his first cousin once removed Myra Gale Brown, lasted for 13 years, from December 1957 to December 1970 (although the couple went through a second marriage ceremony because his divorce from Jane Mitchum was not complete before the first ceremony took place). They had two children together: Steve Allen Lewis (1959–1962) and Phoebe Allen Lewis (b. 1963). His fourth marriage, to Jaren Elizabeth Gunn Pate, lasted from October 1971 to June 8, 1982, and they had a daughter, Lori Lee Lewis (b. 1972). Pate drowned in a swimming pool at the home of a friend with whom she was staying, several weeks before divorce proceedings could be finalized.[33] His fifth marriage, to Shawn Stephens, lasted 77 days, from June to August 1983, ending with her death.[34] Journalist Richard Ben Cramer alleged that Lewis abused her and may have been responsible for her death, but the allegations have never been verified.[35] His sixth marriage, to Kerrie McCarver, lasted 21 years, from April 1984 to June 2005.[36] They have one child: Jerry Lee Lewis III (b. 1987). His seventh marriage, to Judith Brown, began March 9, 2012.[31] Lewis has had six children during his marriages. In 1962, his son Steve Allen Lewis drowned in a swimming pool accident when he was three, and in 1973, Jerry Lee Lewis, Jr. died at the age of 19[32][37] when he overturned the Jeep he was driving.[32] He has two surviving sons, Ronnie Guy Lewis and Jerry Lee Lewis III, and two daughters, Phoebe Allen Lewis and Lori Lee Lewis.In 1993 Lewis moved to Ireland with his family in what was suggested (but denied) to be a move to avoid issues with the Internal Revenue Service.[38] He lived in a rented house in Westminster Road, Foxrock, Dublin and during his time there was sued by the German company Neue Constantin Film Production GmbH for failure to appear at a concert in Munich in 1993.[39] Lewis returned to the US in 1997 after his tax issues had been resolved by Irish promoter Kieran Cavanagh.[40]In 1976, Lewis was famously arrested outside Elvis Presley\\'s Graceland home for allegedly intending to shoot him. Lewis had already nearly killed his bass player Butch Owens on September 29 (Lewis\\'s 41st birthday) when a .357 accidentally went off in his hand. In Rick Bragg\\'s 2014 authorized biography Jerry Lee Lewis: His Own Story, Lewis explains that the reclusive Presley had been trying to reach him and finally did on November 23, imploring that he \"come out to the house.\" Lewis replied that he would if he had time but that he was busy trying to get his father Elmo out of jail in Tunica for driving under the influence. Later that night, Lewis was at a Memphis nightclub called Vapors drinking champagne when he was given a gun. \"Charles Feron, he owned Vapors, he give it to me,\" Lewis explained to Bragg. \"A .38 derringer. Me, pretty well drunk, with that derringer – it ain\\'t somethin\\' strange.\" Lewis suddenly remembered that Elvis wanted to see him and, climbing aboard his new Lincoln Continental with the loaded pistol on the dash and a bottle of champagne under his arm, tore off for Graceland. Just before three o\\'clock in the morning, Lewis accidentally smashed into the famous Graceland gates because \"the nose of that Lincoln was a mile long.\"[this quote needs a citation]Presley\\'s astonished cousin Harold Lloyd was manning the gate and watched Lewis attempt to hurl the champagne bottle through the car window, not realizing it was rolled up, smashing both. Bragg reports that Lewis denies ever intending to do Presley harm, that the two were friends, but \"Elvis, watching on the closed-circuit television, told guards to call the police. The Memphis police found the gun in the car and put Jerry Lee, protesting, hollering, threatening them, away in handcuffs.\" Lewis: \"The cops asked Elvis, \\'What do you want us to do? And Elvis told \\'em, \\'Lock him up.\\' That hurt my feelings. To be scared of me – knowin\\' me the way he did – was ridiculous.\" Lewis was charged with carrying a pistol and public drunkenness. Released on a $250 bond, his defiant mug shot was wired around the world. Presley would die at Graceland of a heart attack eight months later.[41][42][43][44][45]As a teenager, Lewis studied at the Southwest Bible Institute in Waxahachie, Texas before being thrown out for daring to play a boogie-woogie version of \"My God Is Real\", and that early incident foreshadowed his lifelong conflict over his faith in God and his love of playing \"the devil\\'s music.\" Lewis had a recorded argument with Sam Phillips during the recording session for \"Great Balls of Fire\", a song he initially refused to record because he considered it blasphemous (\"How can...How can the devil save souls? What are you talkin\\' about?\" he asks Phillips during one heated exchange). During the famous Million Dollar Quartet jam involving Lewis, Elvis Presley, Carl Perkins, and Johnny Cash, they performed several gospel songs. Lewis\\'s biographer Rick Bragg explains that part of the reason the recording only features Lewis and Elvis singing is because \"only Elvis and Jerry Lee [were] raised in the Assembly of God\", and \"\\'Johnny and Carl didn\\'t really know the words … they was Baptists\\', [Lewis] said, and therefore deprived.\"[46]Lewis also endured years of condemnation from his cousin, evangelist Jimmy Lee Swaggart, who never passed up an opportunity to criticize Lewis\\'s lifestyle. In the 1990 documentary The Jerry Lee Lewis Story, Lewis explains to the interviewer, \"The Bible don\\'t even speak of religion. No word of religion is even in the Bible.[47] Sanctification! Are you sanctified? Have you been saved? See, I was a good preacher, I know my Bible... I find myself falling short of the glory of God.\"Gospel music was a staple of his performing repertoire. After a string of hit country albums, he decided to record a proper gospel album for the first time in 1970.Lewis is widely hailed as one of the most influential pianists in the history of rock and roll. In an often quoted tribute, Elvis Presley once said that if he could play the piano like Lewis he would quit singing. Lewis\\'s pivotal role in popularizing the piano in rock and roll is indisputable. Up until his arrival, the music had been primarily associated with guitars, but his early Sun recordings and television appearances pushed the instrument to the forefront. Lewis was also an incendiary showman who often played with his fists, elbows, feet, and backside, sometimes climbing on top of the piano during gigs and even apocryphally setting it on fire. Like Chuck Berry\\'s guitar playing, Lewis\\'s piano style has become synonymous with rock and roll, having influenced generations of piano players. In a 2013 interview with Leah Harper, Elton John recalls that up until \"Great Balls of Fire,\" \"the piano playing that I had heard had been more sedate. My dad collected George Shearing records, but this was the first time I heard someone beat the shit out of a piano. When I saw Little Richard at the Harrow Granada, he played it standing up, but Jerry Lee Lewis actually jumped on the piano! This was astonishing to me, that people could do that. Those records had such a huge effect on me, and they were just so great. I learned to play like that.\" Lewis is primarily known for his \"boogie woogie\" style, which is characterized by a regular left hand bass figure and dancing beat, but his command of the instrument and highly individualistic style set him apart. Appearing on Memphis Sounds with George Klein in 2011, Lewis credited his older piano-playing cousin Carl McVoy as being a crucial influence, stating, \"He was a great piano player, a great singer, and a nice looking man, carried himself real well. I miss Carl very much.\" Lewis also cited Moon Mullican as a source of inspiration. Although almost entirely self-taught, Lewis conceded to biographer Rich Bragg in 2014 that Paul Whitehead, a blind pianist from Meadville, Mississippi, was another key influence on him in his earliest days playing clubs, confiding, \"Paul Whitehead done a lot. His lesson was worth a billion dollars to me...He taught me. I\\'d sit beside him, and say, \\'Mr. Paul, can you show me exactly how you do that?\\' Mr. Paul was good to me.\"Although Lewis\\'s piano playing is commonly labelled boogie woogie, gospel music was another major influence in the formation of his technique. In Joe Bonomo\\'s 2009 book Jerry Lee Lewis: Lost and Found, Memphis producer and musician Jim Dickinson calls Lewis\\'s occasional penchant for interrupting the standard boogie woogie left-hand progression by omitting the seventh and repeating the fifth and sixth, creating a repetitive, driving, quasi-menacing momentum, \"revolutionary, almost inexplicable. Maybe Ella Mae Morse, maybe Moon Mullican had done it, but not in a way that became the propelling force of the song. Rock and roll piano up to that point had been defined by Rosco Gordon, Ike Turner, and to an extent, Ray Charles. None of them were doing that. Even Little Richard, as primitive as he plays, wasn\\'t doing that shuffle...There was something in Jerry Lee that didn\\'t want to play that seventh, and that\\'s the church. Certainly in white spiritual music you avoid sevenths.\"Further information: Jerry Lee Lewis discographyLewis wrote or co-wrote the following songs: \"End of the Road\" (1956), \"Lewis Boogie\" (1956), \"Pumpin\\' Piano Rock\"[48] (1957), \"High School Confidential\" (1958), \"Memory of You\"[49] (1958), \"Baby Baby Bye Bye\"[50] (1960), \"Lewis Workout\"[51] (1960), \"He Took It Like a Man\" (1963, from the 1967 album Soul My Way), \"Baby, Hold Me Close\"[52] (1965) from the 1965 album The Return of Rock, \"What a Heck of a Mess\"[53] (1966), \"Lincoln Limousine\"[54] (1966), \"Alvin\"[55] (1970), \"Rockin\\' Jerry Lee\"[56] (1980, the B side of \"Honky Tonk Stuff\", from the album When Two Worlds Collide), \"Pilot Baby\"[57] (1983), and \"Crown Victoria Custom \\'51\"[58] (1995), released as a Sire 45 single B side.', 'JimJonesRevue': 'The Jim Jones Revue was a UK garage rock and roll band composed of Jim Jones, Rupert Orton, Henri Herbert, Gavin Jay and Nick Jones.The band was formed after Jim Jones met Rupert Orton (the brother of folk singer Beth Orton) at his Not The Same Old Blues Crap club night in London.[1] In 2008, the band recorded their self-titled debut album in just 48 hours, in a rehearsal space in Camden Town, London.[1] The album was released on 8 September 2008 via Punk Rock Blues Records.A collection of singles and B-sides entitled Here To Save Your Soul was released on 5 October 2009.The band then recorded their second album, Burning Your House Down, which was produced by Jim Sclavunos of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds and Grinderman. In interview Jim Jones has explained that they also chose Sclavunos for his work with bands like Sonic Youth and The Cramps.[2] This second album was released on 16 August 2011 through Punk Rock Blues Records / PIAS Recordings.On 2 September 2010, the band previewed Burning Your House Down at London nightclub Madame Jojo\\'s in front of a sold-out audience, which included Oasis singer Liam Gallagher as well as members of Grinderman and Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds.[3]They appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman (CBS-TV) on 7 September 2011.The band released their third album The Savage Heart on 12 October 2012 through Punk Rock Blues Records / PIAS Recordings.The band pianist, Henri Herbert, put on an impromptu performance on a public piano at St. Pancras International train station, London. The video was uploaded on 6 July 2013 and has since gone viral, receiving more than 13,363,000 views.In June 2014 the band announced that they would cease performing and recording in October 2014 after their \"Last Hurrah\" tour.Their style has been compared to early rock and roll artists Little Richard and Jerry Lee Lewis[4][5] as well as to punk rock bands such as The Stooges, MC5 and Motörhead.[5][6]The BBC\\'s Johnny Sharp wrote that the band\\'s \"string-shredding guitar, furiously chattering piano and blistering, blustery rhythm\" meant that \"you’re bombarded with sonic viscera\".[7]In reference to the band\\'s second album, The Guardian\\'s Michael Hann said that, \"Burning Your House Down sounds like a gangfight set to 12-bar blues\" and that \"The Jim Jones Revue imagine that rock\\'n\\'roll didn\\'t really need to evolve after 1956; it just needed to get much, much louder, and wildly more distorted\".[4]', 'JimmyYancey': 'James Edwards \"Jimmy\" Yancey (February 20, 1894 or 1901[1] – September 17, 1951)[2][3][4] was an African-American boogie-woogie pianist, composer, and lyricist. One reviewer described him as \"one of the pioneers of this raucous, rapid-fire, eight-to-the-bar piano style\".[3]Yancey was born in Chicago. There is uncertainty over his birth year: at different times he stated 1900 and 1903,[1] and other sources give 1894[3] or 1898.[4] Researchers Bob Eagle and Eric LeBlanc suggest 1901.[1]His older brother, Alonzo Yancey (1897–1944),[1] was also a pianist, and their father was a vaudeville guitarist and singer. By age ten, Yancey had toured across the United States as a tap dancer and singer, and by twenty he had toured throughout Europe. He began teaching himself to play the piano at the age of 15, and by 1915 had become a noted pianist and was already influencing younger musicians, including Meade Lux Lewis and Albert Ammons.[2][3]He played in a boogie-woogie style, with a strong-repeated figure in the left hand and melodic decoration in the right, but his playing was delicate and subtle rather than hard driving. He popularized the left-hand figure that became known as the \"Yancey bass\", later used in Pee Wee Crayton\\'s \"Blues After Hours\", Guitar Slim\\'s \"The Things That I Used to Do\", and many other songs.[5] Yancey favored keys—such as E-flat and A-flat—that were atypical for barrelhouse blues.[2] Distinctively, he ended many pieces in the key of E-flat, even if he had played in a different key until the ending.Although influential from an early age, Yancey did not record at all in his early career, performing only at house parties and clubs. His first recordings, in 1939, created a considerable stir in blues and jazz circles.[6]He made most of his recordings solo, but later in his career he recorded with his wife, Estelle Yancey, singing, as Jimmy and Mama Yancey.[5] They appeared in concert at Carnegie Hall in 1948,[2] and recorded their first album in 1951, released by Atlantic Records the following year.[2]During World War I, Yancey played baseball for the Chicago All-Americans, a Negro league baseball team. From 1925 to 1950,[1] he worked as a groundskeeper for the Chicago White Sox.[5]Yancey died of a diabetes-induced stroke in Chicago on September 17, 1951.[4] He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1986.[4]In 1973 the Dutch composer Louis Andriessen premiered On Jimmy Yancey, a two-movement work scored for nine wind instruments, piano and double bass. Andriessen observes that Yancey was not merely one of the pioneers of the boogie-woogie piano style. \"The leaping left hand of Ragtime changed into a monotonous repeating train-like figure, which in fact was more melodious than the Ragtime bass. In the first movement, three Yancey themes are quoted; the second is a kind of In Memoriam. Both movements end with a typical boogie-woogie lick, with which Yancey unexpectedly ends all his recordings. He probably did this at a sign from the producer, when the three minutes which a 78 side could hold were up, because boogie-woogie pianists habitually played for hours on end in the bars to entertain the white bourgeoisie.\"[7]', 'JoeKrown': 'Joe Krown is an American keyboardist, based in New Orleans, Louisiana. He is known for his long tenure with Clarence \"Gatemouth\" Brown\\'s band. As a solo artist, he has been playing in several different styles. When he plays the piano, he typically plays in the traditional New Orleans style. When he plays with his band the Joe Krown Organ Combo, the sound is jazzy and funky,[citation needed] and he plays the Hammond B-3 organ.Krown was raised in Westbury, Long Island, New York.[citation needed] He started playing piano in his childhood. While attending the State University of New York at Buffalo, he discovered the Hammond organ, and soon left the University to pursue career as a professional musician.[1] He became part of a jazz-rock band called Bellevista featuring guitarist Peter Calo that had regional success.In the 1980s, Krown relocated to Boston, formed his own band with his then wife and played around New York and New England. He also joined Chuck Berry\\'s back up band and toured with him on the East Coast.[1]Krown joined ex-Muddy Waters guitarist Luther \"Guitar Junior\" Johnson\\'s band in the late 1980s. He toured and recorded two albums with Johnson during his tenure with his band.In 1992, Krown moved to New Orleans to join Gatemouth\\'s band, Gate\\'s Express. From then on he held the keyboard chair of the band until Gatemouth\\'s death in 2005. Krown recorded four albums with him, and toured across U.S. and overseas.[2] In 1995, Gatemouth was chosen as an opening act for Eric Clapton\\'s world tour, and Krown toured with him as a member of the band.[2]In 1998 he debuted as a solo artist. He released Just the Piano...Just the Blues on STR Digital Records. It was a piano solo album in strictly traditional blues and boogie woogie style.In 1999, Krown formed the Joe Krown Organ Combo and the band released its debut album Down & Dirty that year. On the album, Krown showed wider range of sound playing the organ only throughout the album. Gatemouth was featured as a guest soloist on three tracks.[3] He was also featured on four tracks on Krown\\'s following album Buckle Up released in 2000.[4]The Organ Combo soon started to play regularly in New Orleans as well as some dates in Europe, San Francisco, and Ottawa.[2] The band released its second album Funk Yard in 2002.Apart from the Organ Combo, Krown started to play with guitarist John Fohl and harmonica/accordion player Johnny Sansone in 2000. They played traditional blues with Krown on piano, and Fohl and Sansone sharing the vocal duties. This trio Sansone, Krown & Fohl released a self-titled album from Sansone\\'s label ShortStack Records in 2004.[2]Krown\\'s other projects include Joe Krown\\'s Swing Band which he started in 2003, Joe Krown Trio a collaboration with his Organ Combo band mates Brint Anderson and Mike Barras which led to the album Old Friends (2007), and another trio Krown, Washington, Batiste (teaming up with Walter \"Wolfman\" Washington on guitar and vocals and Russell Batiste, Jr. on drums) who started to play at Maple Leaf Bar in 2007. Krown has also worked as a member of funk band Juice appearing on their live album Hey Buddy in 2005.In the fall of 2007, Joe was chosen as one of the featured acts in the \\'Solid Blues\\' package tour with Mavis Staples, Charlie Musselwhite, and The North Mississippi All-Stars covering 38 cities in the U.S.Krown\\'s latest effort is Live at the Maple Leaf (2008), his first live album with the Krown, Washington, Batiste trio.', 'JohnLeeHooker': 'John Lee Hooker (c. August 22, 1912[1] – June 21, 2001) was an American blues singer, songwriter, and guitarist. The son of a sharecropper, he rose to prominence performing an electric guitar-style adaptation of Delta blues. Hooker often incorporated other elements, including talking blues and early North Mississippi Hill country blues. He developed his own driving-rhythm boogie style, distinct from the 1930s–1940s piano-derived boogie-woogie.Some of his best known songs include \"Boogie Chillen\\'\" (1948), \"Crawling King Snake\" (1949), \"Dimples\" (1956), \"Boom Boom\" (1962), and \"One Bourbon, One Scotch, One Beer\" (1966). Several of his later albums, including The Healer (1989), Mr. Lucky (1991), Chill Out (1995), and Don\\'t Look Back (1997), were album chart successes in the U.S. and U.K., and Don\\'t Look Back won a Grammy Award in 1998.Hooker\\'s date of birth is a subject of debate.[2][5] It is believed that he was born in Tutwiler, Mississippi, in Tallahatchie County, although some sources say his birthplace was near Clarksdale, in Coahoma County.[6] He was the youngest of the 11 children of William Hooker (born 1871, died after 1923),[7] a sharecropper and Baptist preacher, and Minnie Ramsey (born c. 1880, date of death unknown). In the 1920 federal census,[8] William and Minnie were recorded as being 48 and 39 years old, respectively, which implies that Minnie was born about 1880, not 1875. She was said to have been a \"decade or so younger\" than her husband (Boogie Man, p.\\xa023), which gives additional credibility to this census record as evidence of Hooker\\'s origins.The Hooker children were home-schooled. They were permitted to listen only to religious songs; the spirituals sung in church were their earliest exposure to music. In 1921, their parents separated. The next year, their mother married William Moore, a blues singer, who provided John Lee with an introduction to the guitar (and whom he would later credit for his distinctive playing style).[9] Moore was his first significant blues influence. He was a local blues guitarist who, in Shreveport, Louisiana, learned to play a droning, one-chord blues that was strikingly different from the Delta blues of the time.[6] Another formative influence was Tony Hollins, who dated Hooker\\'s sister Alice, helped teach Hooker to play, and gave him his first guitar. For the rest of his life, Hooker regarded Hollins as a formative influence on his style of playing and his career as a musician. Among the songs that Hollins reputedly taught Hooker were versions of \"Crawlin\\' King Snake\" and \"Catfish Blues\".[10]At the age of 14, Hooker ran away from home, reportedly never seeing his mother or stepfather again.[11] In the mid-1930s, he lived in Memphis, Tennessee, where he performed on Beale Street, at the New Daisy Theatre and occasionally at house parties.[6]He worked in factories in various cities during World War II, eventually getting a job with the Ford Motor Company in Detroit in 1943. He frequented the blues clubs and bars on Hastings Street, the heart of the black entertainment district, on Detroit\\'s east side. In a city noted for its pianists, guitar players were scarce. Hooker\\'s popularity grew quickly as he performed in Detroit clubs, and, seeking an instrument louder than his acoustic guitar, he bought his first electric guitar.[12]Hooker\\'s recording career began in 1948, when Modern Records, based in Los Angeles, released a demo he had recorded for Bernie Besman in Detroit. The single, \"Boogie Chillen\\'\", became a hit and the best-selling race record of 1949.[6] Despite being illiterate, Hooker was a prolific lyricist. In addition to adapting traditional blues lyrics, he composed original songs. In the 1950s, like many black musicians, Hooker earned little from record sales, and so he often recorded variations of his songs for different studios for an up-front fee. To evade his recording contract, he used various pseudonyms, including John Lee Booker (for Chess Records and Chance Records in 1951–1952), Johnny Lee (for De Luxe Records in 1953–1954), John Lee, John Lee Cooker,[13] Texas Slim, Delta John, Birmingham Sam and his Magic Guitar, Johnny Williams, and the Boogie Man.[14]His early solo songs were recorded by Bernie Besman. Hooker rarely played with a standard beat, but instead he changed tempo to fit the needs of the song. This often made it difficult to use backing musicians, who were not accustomed to Hooker\\'s musical vagaries. As a result, Besman recorded Hooker playing guitar, singing and stomping on a wooden pallet in time with the music.[15] For much of this period he recorded and toured with Eddie Kirkland. In Hooker\\'s later sessions for Vee-Jay Records in Chicago, studio musicians accompanied him on most of his recordings, including Eddie Taylor, who could handle his musical idiosyncrasies. \"Boom Boom\" and \"Dimples\", two popular songs by Hooker, were originally released by Vee-Jay.[16]Hooker performed \"Boom Boom\" in the role of a street musician in the 1980 film The Blues Brothers. In 1989, he recorded the album The Healer with various other notable musicians, including Carlos Santana and Bonnie Raitt.[16]He recorded several songs with Van Morrison, including \"Never Get Out of These Blues Alive\", \"The Healing Game\", and \"I Cover the Waterfront\". He also appeared on stage with Morrison several times; some of these performances released on the live album A Night in San Francisco. On December 19, 1989, Hooker performed \"Boogie Chillen\\'\" with the Rolling Stones and Eric Clapton in Atlantic City, New Jersey. As part of the Rolling Stones\\' Steel Wheels tour, the show was broadcast live on cable television as a pay-per-view program. His last studio recording on guitar and vocal was \"Elizebeth\", a song he wrote with Pete Sears, accompanied by members of his Coast to Coast Blues Band, with Sears on piano. It was recorded on January 14, 1998, at Bayview Studios in Richmond, California. The last song Hooker recorded before his death was \"Ali d\\'Oro\", a collaboration with the Italian soul singer Zucchero, in which Hooker sang the chorus, \"I lay down with an angel.\"Hooker spent the last years of his life in Long Beach, California. In 1997, he opened a nightclub in San Francisco\\'s Fillmore District called John Lee Hooker\\'s Boom Boom Room, after one of his hit songs.[16]Hooker fell ill just before a tour of Europe in 2001 and died in his sleep on June 21, 2001, in Los Altos, California, at around 88 years of age. He was interred at the Chapel of the Chimes in Oakland.[17] He was survived by eight children, 19 grandchildren, and numerous great-grandchildren.[18]Among his many awards, Hooker was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1980,[19] the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1991 and the Memphis Music Hall of Fame in 2016. Two of his songs, \"Boogie Chillen\" and \"Boom Boom\", were included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame\\'s list of the \"500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll\".[20] \"Boogie Chillen\" was also included in the Recording Industry Association of America\\'s list of the \"Songs of the Century\".[21] He was awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2000.[22] He also has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.Larkin, Colin, ed.

He continued his solo career through the early 1980s, releasing an album and several singles between 1981 and 1984. He branched out into TV, co-presenting the Newcastle-based TV music show The Tube with Paula Yates. Holland achieved notoriety by inadvertently using the phrase \"be there, or be an ungroovey fucker\" in an early evening TV trailer, live across two channels, for the show, causing him to be suspended from the show for six weeks.[4] He referred to this in his sitcom The Groovy Fellers with Rowland Rivron.In 1983 Holland played an extended piano solo on The The\\'s re-recording of \"Uncertain Smile\" for the album Soul Mining. In 1985, Squeeze (which had continued in Holland\\'s absence through to 1982) unexpectedly regrouped including Holland as their keyboard player. Holland remained in the band until 1990, at which point he again departed Squeeze to resume his solo career as a musician and a TV host.In 1987, Holland formed the Jools Holland Big Band, which consisted of himself and Gilson Lavis from Squeeze.

On his first album, Leon Russell, in 1970, the musicians included Eric Clapton, Ringo Starr and George Harrison. One of his biggest early fans,[6][7] Elton John said Russell was a \"mentor\" and \"inspiration\". They recorded their album The Union in 2010,[8] which earned them a Grammy nomination.[9]Russell produced and played in recording sessions for Bob Dylan, Frank Sinatra, Ike & Tina Turner, the Rolling Stones, and others.

After performing country music under the name Hank Wilson in the 1970s and 1980s, he largely faded into obscurity.[11]I wanted to give Elton something. But what do you give a guy who has six fully stocked houses? So I thought the only thing I could give him is a song. \"In the Hands of Angels,\" retelling of the story of the album [The Union], thanks Mr. John (\"the guv\\'ner\" in the lyrics), who knew all the places I needed to go and made me feel the love down deep inside.Russell re-emerged in 2010 when Elton John called on him to record the album that became The Union.

The piano part complemented Pete Ham\\'s and George Harrison\\'s dual slide guitars on Badfinger\\'s \"Day After Day\". The Straight Up sessions were interrupted when many of the musicians left for New York City to participate in the Concert For Bangladesh, at which Russell performed a medley of the songs \"Jumpin\\' Jack Flash\" and \"Young Blood\" and sang a verse on Harrison\\'s \"Beware of Darkness\".[29] Bob Dylan surprised Russell by asking him to play bass for some of Dylan\\'s portion of the show; Russell and Harrison sang harmonies on the chorus of Just Like a Woman.Russell was busy in 1971, as Shelter Records released Leon Russell and the Shelter People and Asylum Choir II (co-produced by Marc Benno) and recorded at Russell\\'s Skyhill Studios.

A child prodigy and the son of working-class immigrants, Liberace enjoyed a career spanning four decades of concerts, recordings, television, motion pictures, and endorsements. At the height of his fame, from the 1950s to the 1970s, Liberace was the highest-paid entertainer in the world,[4] with established residencies in Las Vegas, and an international touring schedule. Liberace embraced a lifestyle of flamboyant excess both on and off stage, acquiring the sobriquet \"Mr. Showmanship\".Liberace (known as \"Lee\" to his friends and \"Walter\" to family)[3] was born in West Allis, Wisconsin. His father, Salvatore (\"Sam\") Liberace (December 9, 1885 – April 1, 1977), was an immigrant from Formia, Italy. His mother, Frances Zuchowska (August 31, 1892 – November 1, 1980), was of Polish descent.[1] Liberace was born with a caul, which in some cultures is considered indicative of genius, good luck, or the promise of a prosperous future.[5] He had a twin, who died at birth.Liberace\\'s father played the French horn in bands and movie theaters but often worked as a factory worker or laborer. While Sam encouraged music in his family, his wife, Frances, believed music lessons and a record player to be unaffordable luxuries. This caused family disputes.[6] Liberace later stated, \"My dad\\'s love and respect for music created in him a deep determination to give as his legacy to the world, a family of musicians dedicated to the advancement of the art\".[7]Liberace began playing the piano at age four. While Sam took his children to concerts to further expose them to music, he was also a taskmaster demanding high standards from the children in both practice and performance. Liberace\\'s prodigious talent was evident from his early years. By age seven, he was capable of memorizing difficult pieces. He studied the technique of the Polish pianist Ignacy Paderewski. At age eight, he met Paderewski backstage after a concert at the Pabst Theater in Milwaukee. \"I was intoxicated by the joy I got from the great virtuoso\\'s playing. My dreams were filled with fantasies of following his footsteps…Inspired and fired with ambition, I began to practice with a fervor that made my previous interest in the piano look like neglect\". Paderewski later became a family friend.[8]The Depression was financially hard on the Liberace family. In childhood, Liberace suffered from a speech impediment and as a teen from the taunts of neighborhood children who mocked him for his effeminate personality and his avoidance of sports and his fondness for cooking and the piano.[9] Liberace concentrated on his piano playing with the help of music teacher Florence Kelly, who oversaw Liberace\\'s musical development for 10 years. He gained experience playing popular music in theaters, on local radio, for dancing classes, for clubs, and for weddings. In 1934, he played jazz piano with a school group called \"The Mixers\" and later with other groups. Liberace also performed in cabarets and strip clubs. Though Sam and Frances did not approve, their son was earning a tidy living during hard times. For a while, Liberace adopted the stage name \"Walter Busterkeys\".[10] He also showed an interest in draftsmanship, design, and painting, and became a fastidious dresser and follower of fashion. By this time, he was already displaying a penchant for turning eccentricities into attention-getting practices, and earned popularity at school, despite some making him an object of ridicule.[11]A participant in a formal classical music competition in 1937, Liberace was praised for his \"flair and showmanship\".[12] At the end of a traditional classical concert in La Crosse in 1939, Liberace played his first requested encore, the popular comedy song \"Three Little Fishies\". He later stated that he played the popular tune in the styles of several different classical composers.[13] The 20-year-old played with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra on January 15, 1940, at the Pabst Theater in Milwaukee, performing Liszt\\'s Second Piano Concerto under the baton of Hans Lange, for which he received strong reviews. He also toured in the Midwest.Between 1942 and 1944, Liberace moved away from straight classical performance and reinvented his act to one featuring \"pop with a bit of classics\" or as he also called it \"classical music with the boring parts left out\". In the early 1940s, he struggled in New York City, but by the mid- and late-1940s, he was performing in night clubs in major cities around the United States, largely abandoning the classical music altogether. He changed from a classical pianist to an entertainer and showman, unpredictably and whimsically mixing the serious with light fare, e.g., Chopin with \"Home on the Range\".[14] For a while, he played piano along with a phonograph on stage. The gimmick helped gain him attention. He also added interaction with the audience—taking requests, talking with the patrons, making jokes, giving lessons to chosen audience members. He also began to pay greater attention to such details as staging, lighting, and presentation. The transformation to entertainer was driven by Liberace\\'s desire to connect directly with his audiences, and secondarily from the reality of the difficult competition in the classical piano world.In 1943, he began to appear in Soundies (the 1940s precursor to music videos). He recreated two flashy numbers from his nightclub act, the standards \"Tiger Rag\" and \"Twelfth Street Rag\". In these films, he was billed as Walter Liberace. Both \"Soundies\" were later released to the home-movie market by Castle Films. In 1944, he made his first appearances in Las Vegas, which later became his principal venue. He was playing at the best clubs, finally appearing at the Persian Room in 1945, with Variety proclaiming, \"Liberace looks like a cross between Cary Grant and Robert Alda. He has an effective manner, attractive hands which he spotlights properly, and withal, rings the bell in the dramatically lighted, well-presented, showmanly routine. He should snowball into box office\". The Chicago Times was similarly impressed: He \"made like Chopin one minute and then turns on a Chico Marx bit the next\".[15]During this time, Liberace worked to refine his act. He added the candelabrum as his trademark, inspired by a similar prop in the Chopin biopic A Song to Remember (1945).[16] He adopted \"Liberace\" as his stage name, making a point in press releases that it was pronounced \"Liber-Ah-chee\".[17] He wore white tie and tails for better visibility in large halls. Besides clubs and occasional work as an accompanist and rehearsal pianist, Liberace played for private parties, including those at the Park Avenue home of millionaire oilman J.\\xa0Paul Getty. By 1947, he was billing himself as \"Liberace—the most amazing piano virtuoso of the present day\".[18] He had to have a piano to match his growing presence, so he bought a rare, oversized, gold-leafed Blüthner Grand, which he hyped up in his press kit as a \"priceless piano\".[19] (Later, he performed with an array of extravagant, custom-decorated pianos, some encrusted with rhinestones and mirrors.) He moved to the Los Angeles neighborhood of North Hollywood in 1947 and was performing at local clubs, such as Ciro\\'s and The Mocambo, for stars such as Rosalind Russell, Clark Gable, Gloria Swanson, and Shirley Temple. He did not always play to packed rooms, and he learned to perform with extra energy to thinner crowds, to maintain his own enthusiasm.[20]Liberace created a publicity machine which helped to make him a star. Despite his success in the supper-club circuit, where he was often an intermission act, his ambition was to reach larger audiences as a headliner and a television, movie, and recording star. Liberace began to expand his act and made it more extravagant, with more costumes and a larger supporting cast. His large-scale Las Vegas act became his hallmark, expanding his fan base, and making him wealthy.His New York City performance at Madison Square Garden in 1954, which earned him a record $138,000 (equivalent to $1,230,000 in 2016) for one performance, was more successful than the great triumph his idol Paderewski had made 20 years earlier.[21] He was mentioned as a sex symbol in The Chordettes 1954 #1 hit \"Mr. Sandman\". By 1955, he was making $50,000 per week at the Riviera Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas and had over 200 official fan clubs with a quarter of a million members.[22] He was making over $1\\xa0million per year from public appearances, and millions from television.[21] Liberace was frequently covered by the major magazines, and he became a pop-culture superstar, but he also became the butt of jokes by comedians and the public.Liberace appeared on the March 8, 1956, episode of the TV quiz program You Bet Your Life hosted by Groucho Marx.[23]Music critics were generally harsh in their assessment of his piano playing. Critic Lewis Funke wrote after the Carnegie Hall concert, Liberace\\'s music \"must be served with all the available tricks, as loud as possible, as soft as possible, and as sentimental as possible. It\\'s almost all showmanship topped by whipped cream and cherries.\" Even worse was his lack of reverence and fealty to the great composers. \"Liberace recreates—if that is the word—each composition in his own image. When it is too difficult, he simplifies it. When it is too simple, he complicates it\". His sloppy technique included \"slackness of rhythms, wrong tempos, distorted phrasing, an excess of prettification and sentimentality, a failure to stick to what the composer has written\".[24]Liberace once stated, \"I don\\'t give concerts, I put on a show.\"[25] Unlike the concerts of classical pianists which normally ended with applause and a retreat off-stage, Liberace\\'s shows ended with the public invited on-stage to touch his clothes, piano, jewelry, and hands. Kisses, handshakes, hugs, and caresses usually followed.[26] A critic summed up his appeal near the end of Liberace\\'s life: \"Mr. Showmanship has another more potent, drawing power to his show: the warm and wonderful way he works his audience. Surprisingly enough, behind all the glitz glitter, the corny false modesty, and the shy smile, Liberace exudes a love that is returned to him a thousand-fold.\"[27]Liberace was a conservative in his politics and faith, eschewing dissidents and rebels. He believed fervently in capitalism and was also fascinated with royalty, ceremony, and luxury. He loved to hobnob with the rich and famous, acting as starstruck with presidents and kings as his fans behaved with him. Yet to his fans, he was still one of them, a Midwesterner who had earned his success through hard work, and who invited them to enjoy it with him.[28]In the next phase of his life, having earned sudden wealth, Liberace spent lavishly—incorporating materialism into his life and his act. He designed and built his first celebrity house in 1953, with a piano theme appearing throughout, including a piano-shaped swimming pool. His dream home, with its lavish furnishings, elaborate bath, and antiques throughout, added to his appeal. He leveraged his fame through hundreds of promotional tie-ins with banks, insurance companies, automobile companies, food companies, and even morticians. Liberace was considered a perfect pitchman, given his folksy connection with his vast audience of housewives. Sponsors sent him complimentary products, including his white Cadillac limousine, and he reciprocated enthusiastically: \"If I am selling tuna fish, I believe in tuna fish.\"[29]The critics had a field day with his gimmicky act, his showy but careful piano playing, his non-stop promotions, and his gaudy display of success, but he remained largely unaffected, as preserved by the famous quotation, first recorded in a letter to a critic, \"Thank you for your very amusing review. After reading it, in fact, my brother George and I laughed all the way to the bank.\"[30] He used a similar response to subsequent poor reviews, famously modifying it to \"I cried all the way to the bank.\"[31] In an appearance on The Tonight Show some years later, Liberace reran the anecdote to Johnny Carson, and finished it by saying, \"I don\\'t cry all the way to the bank any more – I bought the bank!\"Liberace mostly bypassed radio before trying a television career, thinking radio unsuitable given his act\\'s dependency on the visual.[32] Despite his enthusiasm about the possibilities of television, Liberace was disappointed after his early guest appearances on CBS\\'s The Kate Smith Show, and DuMont\\'s Cavalcade of Stars, with Jackie Gleason (later The Jackie Gleason Show on CBS). Liberace was particularly displeased with the frenetic camera work and his short appearance time. He soon wanted his own show where he could control his presentation as he did with his club shows.[33]His first show on local television in Los Angeles was a smash hit, earning the highest ratings of any local show, which he parlayed into a sold-out appearance at the Hollywood Bowl.[34] That led to a summer replacement program for Dinah Shore.The 15-minute network television program, The Liberace Show, began on July 1, 1952, but did not lead to a regular network series. Instead, producer Duke Goldstone mounted a filmed version of Liberace\\'s local show performed before a live audience for syndication in 1953 and sold it to scores of local stations. The widespread exposure of the syndicated series made the pianist more popular and prosperous than ever. His first two years\\' earnings from television netted him $7 million and on future reruns, he earned up to 80% of the profits.[22]Liberace learned early on to add \"schmaltz\" to his television show and to cater to the tastes of the mass audience by joking and chatting to the camera as if performing in the viewer\\'s own living room. He also used dramatic lighting, split images, costume changes, and exaggerated hand movements to create visual interest. His television performances featured enthusiasm and humor.Liberace also employed \"ritualistic domesticity\", used by such early TV greats as Jack Benny and Lucille Ball.[35] His brother George often appeared as guest violinist and orchestra director, and his mother was usually in the front row of the audience, with brother Rudy and sister Angelina often mentioned to lend an air of \"family\". Liberace began each show in the same way, then mixed production numbers with chat, and signed off each broadcast softly singing \"I\\'ll Be Seeing You\", which he made his theme song. His musical selections were broad, including classics, show tunes, film melodies, Latin rhythms, ethnic songs, and boogie-woogie.[36]The show was so popular with his mostly female television audience, he drew over 30 million viewers at any one time and received 10,000 fan letters per week.[37] His show was also one of the first to be shown on British commercial television in the 1950s, where it was broadcast on Sunday afternoons by Lew Grade\\'s Associated TeleVision. This exposure gave Liberace a dedicated following in the United Kingdom. Homosexual men also found him appealing. According to author Darden Asbury Pyron, \"Liberace was the first gay person Elton John had ever seen on television; he became his hero.\"[38]In 1956, Liberace had his first international engagement, playing successfully in Havana, Cuba. He followed up with a European tour later that year. Always a devout Catholic, Liberace considered his meeting with Pope Pius XII a highlight of his life.[39] In 1960, Liberace performed at the London Palladium with Nat King Cole and Sammy Davis, Jr. (this was the first televised \"command performance\", now known as the Royal Variety Performance, for Queen Elizabeth II).On July 19, 1957, hours after Liberace gave a deposition in his $25 million libel suit against Confidential magazine, two masked intruders attacked his mother in the garage of Liberace\\'s home in Sherman Oaks. She was beaten and kicked, but her heavy corset may have protected her from being badly injured. Liberace was not informed about the assault until he finished his midnight show at the Moulin Rouge nightclub. Guards were hired to watch over Liberace\\'s house and the houses of his two brothers.Despite successful European tours, his career had in fact been slumping since 1957, but Liberace built it back up by appealing directly to his fan base. Through live appearances in small-town supper clubs, and with television and promotional appearances, he began to regain popularity. On November 22, 1963, he suffered renal failure, reportedly from accidentally inhaling excessive amounts of dry cleaning fumes from his newly cleaned costumes in a Pittsburgh dressing room, and nearly died. He later said that what saved him from further injury was being woken up by his entourage to the news that John F. Kennedy had been assassinated. Told by doctors that his condition was fatal, he began to spend his entire fortune by buying extravagant gifts of furs, jewels, and even a house for friends, but then recovered after a month.[40]Re-energized, Liberace returned to Las Vegas, and upping the glamor and glitz, he took on the sobriquet \"Mr. Showmanship\". As his act swelled with spectacle, he famously stated, \"I\\'m a one-man Disneyland.\"[41] The costumes became more exotic (ostrich feathers, mink, capes, and huge rings), entrances and exits more elaborate (chauffeured onstage in a Rolls-Royce or dropped in on a wire like Peter Pan), choreography more complex (involving chorus girls, cars, and animals), and the novelty acts especially talented, with juvenile acts including Australian singer Jamie Redfern and Canadian banjo player Scotty Plummer.[42] Barbra Streisand was the most notable new adult act he introduced, appearing with him early in her career.[43]Liberace\\'s energy and commercial ambitions took him in many directions. He owned an antiques store in Beverly Hills, California, and a restaurant in Las Vegas for many years. He even published cookbooks, the most famous of these being Liberace Cooks, co-authored by cookbook guru Carol Truax, which included \"Liberace Lasagna\" and \"Liberace Sticky Buns.\" The book features recipes \"from his seven dining rooms\" (of his Hollywood home).Liberace\\'s live shows during the 1970s–80s remained major box-office attractions at the Las Vegas Hilton and Lake Tahoe, where he earned $300,000 a week.In 1970, Liberace competed against Irish actor Richard Harris for the purchase of The Tower House, in Holland Park, west London. Harris eventually bought the house after discovering that Liberace had agreed to buy it, but had not yet put down a deposit.[44] British entertainer Danny La Rue visited The Tower House with Liberace and later recounted in his autobiography a paranormal experience that he had there with him.[45]Liberace also made significant appearances on other shows such as The Ed Sullivan Show, The Ford Show, Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford, Edward R. Murrow\\'s Person to Person, and on the shows of Jack Benny and Red Skelton, on which he often parodied his own persona. A new Liberace Show premiered on ABC\\'s daytime schedule in 1958, featuring a less flamboyant, less glamorous persona, but it failed in six months, as his popularity began slumping.[46] Liberace received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960 for his contributions to the television industry. He continued to appear on television as a frequent and welcomed guest on The Tonight Show with Jack Paar in the 1960s, with memorable exchanges with Zsa Zsa Gabor and Muhammad Ali, and later with Johnny Carson. He was also Red Skelton\\'s 1969 CBS summer replacement with his own variety hour, taped in London. Skelton and Lew Grade\\'s production companies co-produced this program. In a cameo on The Monkees, he appeared at an avant garde art gallery as himself, gleefully smashing a grand piano with a sledgehammer as Mike Nesmith looked on and cringed in mock agony.In the Batman television series in 1966 with Adam West and Burt Ward, Liberace played a dual role as concert pianist Chandell and his gangster-like twin Harry, who was extorting Chandell into a life of crime as \"Fingers\", in the episodes \"The Devil\\'s Fingers\" and \"The Dead Ringers\", both written by Lorenzo Semple Jr., who had developed Batman for television. The episodes of this two-part story were, according to Joel Eisner\\'s The Official Batman Batbook, the highest-rated of all the show\\'s episodes. His subsequent television appearances included episodes of Here\\'s Lucy (1970), Kojak, and The Muppet Show (both 1978), all as himself. His performances in the last of these included a \"Concerto for the Birds\", \"Misty\", \"Five Foot Two\", and a rendition of \"Chopsticks\". Television specials were made from Liberace\\'s show at the Las Vegas Hilton in 1978-79 which were broadcast on CBS.In the 1980s, he guest-starred on television shows such as Saturday Night Live (on a 10th-season episode hosted by Hulk Hogan and Mr. T), and the 1984 film Special People. In 1985, he appeared at the first WrestleMania as the guest timekeeper for the main event.[47]Even before his arrival in Hollywood in 1947, Liberace wanted to add acting to his list of accomplishments. His exposure to the Hollywood crowd through his club performances led to his first movie appearance in Universal\\'s South Sea Sinner (1950), a tropical island drama starring Macdonald Carey and Shelley Winters, in which he was 14th-billed as \"a Hoagy Carmichael sort of character with long hair.\"[48] Liberace also appeared as a guest star in two compilation features for RKO Radio Pictures. Footlight Varieties (1951) is an imitation-vaudeville hour and a little-known sequel, Merry Mirthquakes (1953), featured Liberace as master of ceremonies.In 1955, Liberace was at the height of his career when tapped by Warner Bros. for his first starring motion picture, Sincerely Yours (1955), a remake of The Man Who Played God (1932), as a concert pianist who turns his efforts toward helping others when his career is cut short by deafness. In April 1955, Modern Screen magazine claimed Doris Day had been most often mentioned as Liberace’s leading lady, \"but it is doubtful that Doris will play the role. Liberace’s name alone will pack theatres and generous Liberace would like to give a newcomer a break.\" (Joanne Dru, an established movie actress, was the leading lady.) When Sincerely Yours was released in November, the studio mounted an ad and poster campaign with Liberace’s name in huge, eccentric, building-block letters above and much larger than the title. \"Fabulously yours in his first starring motion picture!\" was a tag line. The other players and staff were smallish at the bottom. The film was a critical and commercial failure since Liberace proved unable to translate his eccentric on-stage persona to that of a movie leading man. Warner quickly issued a pressbook ad supplement with new \"Starring\" billing below the title, in equal plain letters: \"Liberace, Joanne Dru, Dorothy Malone\". TCM\\'s Robert Osborne recalls a more dramatic demotion: When Sincerely Yours played first run at the Orpheum in Seattle, the billing was altered even more: Joanne Dru, Dorothy Malone, and Alex Nicol above the title (with big head shots of all three) and below the title in much smaller letters: \"with Liberace at the piano\". Originally, Sincerely Yours was meant to be the first of a two-picture movie contract, but it proved a massive box-office flop. The studio then bought back the contract, effectively paying Liberace not to make a second movie.The experience left Liberace so shaken that he largely abandoned his movie aspirations. He made two more big-screen appearances, but only in cameo roles. These were When the Boys Meet the Girls (1965), starring Connie Francis, where Liberace essentially played himself. He received kudos for his brief appearance as a casket salesman in The Loved One (1966), based on Evelyn Waugh\\'s satire of the funeral business and movie industry in Southern California.The massive success of Liberace\\'s syndicated television show was the main impetus behind his record sales. From 1947-51, he recorded 10 discs. By 1954, it jumped to nearly 70.[49] He released several recordings through Columbia Records including Liberace by Candlelight (later on Dot and through direct television advertising) and sold over 400,000 albums by 1954. His most popular single was \"Ave Maria\", selling over 300,000 copies.[50]His albums included pop standards of the time, such as \"Hello, Dolly!\", and also included his interpretations of the classical piano repertoire such as Chopin and Liszt, although many fans of classical music widely criticized them (as well as Liberace\\'s skills as a pianist in general) for being \"pure fluff with minimal musicianship\". In his life, he received six gold records.Liberace\\'s fame in the United States was matched for a time in the United Kingdom. In 1956, an article in the Daily Mirror by columnist Cassandra (William Connor)[51] described Liberace as \"…the summit of sex—the pinnacle of masculine, feminine, and neuter. Everything that he, she, and it can ever want… a deadly, winking, sniggering, snuggling, chromium-plated, scent-impregnated, luminous, quivering, giggling, fruit-flavoured, mincing, ice-covered heap of mother love\", a description which strongly implied that he was homosexual.[52]Liberace sent a telegram that read: \"What you said hurt me very much. I cried all the way to the bank.\" [31] He sued the newspaper for libel,[53] testifying in a London court that he was not homosexual and that he had never taken part in homosexual acts. He was represented in court by one of the great barristers of the period, 75 year old Gilbert Beyfus QC, who displayed all his old flair despite being unwell.[54] They won the suit, partly on the basis of Connor\\'s use of the derogatory expression \"fruit-flavoured\". The case partly hinged on whether Connor knew that \\'fruit\\' was American slang implying that an individual is a homosexual.[55] The £8,000 damages he received from the Daily Mirror (worth about £167,900 today) led Liberace to repeat the catchphrase to reporters: \"I cried all the way to the bank!\"[56] Liberace\\'s popularization of the phrase inspired the title of Crying All the Way to the Bank, a detailed report of the trial based on transcripts, court reports, and interviews, by the former Daily Mirror journalist Revel Barker.Liberace fought and settled a similar case in the United States against Confidential. Rumors and gossip magazines frequently implied that he was gay. A typical issue of Confidential in 1957 shouted, \"Why Liberace\\'s Theme Song Should Be \\'Mad About the Boy!\\'\"[57]In 1982, Scott Thorson, Liberace\\'s 22-year-old former chauffeur and live-in lover of five years, sued the pianist for $113 million in palimony after he was let go by Liberace.[58] Liberace continued to deny that he was homosexual, and during court depositions in 1984, he insisted that Thorson was never his lover. The case was settled out of court in 1986, with Thorson receiving a $75,000 cash settlement, plus three cars and three pet dogs worth another $20,000.[58] Thorson stated after Liberace\\'s death that he settled because he knew that Liberace was dying and that he had intended to sue based on conversion of property rather than palimony. He later attested that Liberace was a \"boring guy\" in his private life and mostly preferred to spend his free time cooking, decorating, and playing with his dogs, and also that he never played the piano outside of his public performances. According to Thorson: \"He (Liberace) had several decorated, ornamental pianos in the various rooms of his house, but he never played them.\" Thorson also remarked that he was not aware that Liberace had any health issues prior to contracting acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and up until one year before his death that: \"He was in overall excellent shape for his age; barrel-chested and powerfully built.\"[59]Because Liberace never publicly acknowledged that he was gay, confusion over his true sexuality was further muddled in the public\\'s mind by his public friendships and his romantic links with women.[60] He further obscured his sexuality in articles like \"Mature Women Are Best: TV\\'s Top Pianist Reveals What Kind of Woman He\\'d Marry.\"[61]In a 2011 interview, actress and close friend Betty White stated that Liberace was indeed gay and that she was often used as a beard by his managers to counter public rumors of the musician\\'s homosexuality.[62]Liberace\\'s final stage performance was at New York\\'s Radio City Music Hall on November 2, 1986;[63] it was his 18th show in 21 days, and the series grossed $2.5\\xa0million.[64] His final television appearance was on Christmas Day that same year on The Oprah Winfrey Show, which was actually videotaped in Chicago over one month earlier.[65]Liberace was secretly diagnosed HIV positive in August 1985 by his private physician in Las Vegas, 18 months before his death. Also his lover of seven years, Cary James, was infected. Aside from his long-term manager Seymour Heller and a few family members and associates, Liberace kept his terminal illness a secret until the day he died and did not seek any medical treatment. In late 1986, during one of his last interviews, Liberace remarked: \"How can you enjoy life if you don\\'t have your health?\" He was hospitalized from January 23 to January 27, 1987.Liberace died of cytomegalovirus pneumonia[66] as a result of AIDS on February 4, 1987, at his home in Palm Springs, California.[67] He was 67 years old.A devout Roman Catholic to the end, he had a priest administer the last rites to him the day before his death. The original cause of death was attributed variously to anemia (due to a diet of watermelon), emphysema, and heart disease, the last of which was attested to by Liberace\\'s personal physician, Dr. Ronald Daniels.[68] However, the Riverside County coroner, against the advice of Dr. Daniels, performed an autopsy and later stated that \"a deliberate attempt\" had been made to hide the actual cause of death by Liberace\\'s doctors, his manager, and Liberace\\'s entire immediate family. The post mortem discovered that Liberace had emphysema and coronary artery disease from years of chain smoking, but the real cause of death was pneumonia due to complications from AIDS.[66][68] Author Darden Asbury Pyron writes that Liberace had been \"HIV-positive and symptomatic\" from 1985 until his death.[69]Liberace\\'s body is entombed at Forest Lawn, Hollywood Hills Cemetery in Los Angeles.[70][71] In 1994, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs, California, Walk of Stars was dedicated to him.[72]Liberace was recognized during his career with two Emmy Awards, six gold albums, and two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Liberace released a book on his life and performed 56 sold-out shows at Radio City Music Hall which set box-office records a few months before his death in Palm Springs, California, on February 4, 1987.In October 2010, the Liberace Museum in Las Vegas closed after 31 years of being open to the general public. In June 2011, Liberace\\'s Tivoli Gardens Restaurant, then operated by Carluccio\\'s, closed its location next to the museum and relocated elsewhere.[73] According to Liberace Foundation President Jack Rappaport, the museum had been in negotiations with money interests on the Las Vegas strip to relocate the museum but were unsuccessful. The Liberace Foundation, which provides college scholarships to up-and-coming performers, continued to function.[74] In January 2013, the Liberace Foundation announced plans to relocate the museum to downtown Las Vegas, with a targeted opening date of 2014.[75] In 2014, however, Liberace Foundation chairman Jonathan Warren announced that the deal for the new museum had failed.[76]As of April 7, 2016, Liberace\\'s cars are on display, as well as a piano, and several costumes at the \"Liberace Garage\" also located in Las Vegas.[77]Worth over $110 million at the time of his death, Liberace bequeathed the bulk of his estate to his scholarship foundation. His official museum closed its doors in 2010 due to an economic downturn. In November 2013, a few dozen of his famous costumes and cars went on display for a six-week period at the Cosmopolitan Las Vegas in an exhibition titled \"Too Much of a Good Thing Is Wonderful\", Liberace\\'s unofficial motto, and an often-used one-liner from his act.In December 2014, it was announced that Liberace was to tour the world as a Pepper\\'s Ghost \"hologram.\" A simulated version of the musician would be resurrected by some of those responsible for Coachella’s image of Tupac Shakur. A debut performance was scheduled to take place in Las Vegas. Jonathan Warren, chairman of the Liberace Foundation, explained: \"You’ll feel the warmth from his heart, the sparkle of his eye, and the pure lightning from his fingertips.\"[82]', 'LittleRichard': 'Richard Wayne Penniman (born December 5, 1932), known as Little Richard, is an American musician, singer and songwriter.An influential figure in popular music and culture for more than six decades, Little Richard\\'s most celebrated work dates from the mid-1950s, when his dynamic music and charismatic showmanship laid the foundation for rock and roll. His music also played a key role in the formation of other popular music genres, including soul and funk. Little Richard influenced numerous singers and musicians across musical genres from rock to hip hop; his music helped shape rhythm and blues for generations to come, and his performances and headline-making thrust his career right into the mix of American popular music.Little Richard has been honored by many institutions. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as part of its first group of inductees in 1986. He was also inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. He is the recipient of a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Recording Academy and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Rhythm and Blues Foundation. Little Richard\\'s \"Tutti Frutti\" (1955) was included in the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress in 2010, which stated that his \"unique vocalizing over the irresistible beat announced a new era in music.\" In 2015, the National Museum of African American Music[1] honored Little Richard with a Rhapsody & Rhythm Award for his pivotal role in the formation of popular music genres and in helping to shatter the color line on the music charts, changing American culture significantly.Little Richard was born Richard Wayne Penniman on December 5, 1932, in Macon, Georgia. He was the third of twelve children of Leva Mae (née Stewart) and Charles \"Bud\" Penniman. His father was a church deacon who sold bootlegged moonshine on the side and owned a nightclub, the Tip In Inn.[2][3] His mother was a member of Macon\\'s New Hope Baptist Church.[4] Initially, Little Richard\\'s first name was supposed to have been \"Ricardo\" but an error resulted in \"Richard\" instead.[2][5] The Penniman children were raised in a neighborhood of Macon called Pleasant Hill.[4] In childhood, he was nicknamed \"Lil\\' Richard\" by his family, because of his small and skinny frame. A mischievous child who played pranks on neighbors, Little Richard began singing in church at a young age.[6][7] Possibly as a result of complications at birth, Little Richard had a slight deformity that left one of his legs shorter than the other. This produced an unusual gait; he was mocked for his allegedly effeminate appearance.[8]Little Richard\\'s family was very religious, joining various A.M.E., Baptist and Pentecostal churches, with some family members becoming ministers. Little Richard enjoyed the Pentecostal churches the most, because of their charismatic worship and live music.[9] He later recalled that people in his neighborhood during segregation sang gospel songs throughout the day to keep a positive outlook, because \"there was so much poverty, so much prejudice in those days\".[10] He had observed that people sang \"to feel their connection with God\" and to wash their trials and burdens away.[11] Gifted with a loud singing voice, Little Richard recalled that he was \"always changing the key upwards\" and that they once stopped him from singing in church for \"screaming and hollering\" so loud, earning him the nickname \"War Hawk\".[12]Little Richard\\'s initial musical influences were gospel performers such as Brother Joe May, Sister Rosetta Tharpe, Mahalia Jackson and Marion Williams. May, who as a singing evangelist was known as \"the Thunderbolt of the Middle West\" because of his phenomenal range and vocal power, inspired the boy to become a preacher.[13][14] Little Richard attended Macon\\'s Hudson High School,[15] where he was a below-average student. His musical talent, however, was recognized there when he learned to play the alto saxophone. His mother recalled how Richard was \"always musical\" and that when he was young, he would always \"beat on the steps of the house, and on tin cans and pots and pans, or whatever\", while singing.[16] She also recalled that Richard was so quick at learning to play the saxophone, that he was allowed to play with the school\\'s marching band immediately.[16] While in high school, Little Richard obtained a part-time job at Macon City Auditorium for local secular and gospel concert promoter Clint Brantley. Little Richard sold Coca-Cola to crowds during concerts of star performers of the day, such as Cab Calloway, Lucky Millinder and his favorite singer, Sister Rosetta Tharpe.[17]On October 27, 1947, Sister Rosetta Tharpe heard 14-year-old Little Richard singing two of her gospel recordings before her concert at Macon City Auditorium. Tharpe was so impressed that she invited him to sing onstage during the concert.[17] Clint Brantley recalled that Little Richard approached him before the show, announcing that Tharpe was allowing him to open the show. Brantley, as the promoter, told him he could not. However, when the curtain lifted, Little Richard began to sing and surprised Brantley with his vocal ability. The crowd cheered, and Tharpe paid him for his performance. Little Richard was hooked on performing for a living after that.[18] He began singing with traveling shows that came through town and was losing interest in school. He would sing to draw people to the local town prophet and spiritualist, Doctor Nubilio, who wore a turban and a colorful cape, carried a black stick and exhibited something he called \"the devil\\'s child\" – the dried-up body of a baby with claw feet like a bird and horns on its head. Nubilio told Little Richard that he was \"gonna be famous\" but that he would have to \"go where the grass is greener.\"[19] Because of problems at home and school and associations in the community, Little Richard left and joined Dr. Hudson\\'s Medicine Show in 1948, performing \"Caldonia\".[19] Little Richard recalled the song was the first secular R&B song he learned, since his family had strict rules against playing R&B music, which they considered \"devil music.\"[20] Little Richard soon joined his first musical band, Buster Brown\\'s Orchestra. While performing with the band, he began using the name Little Richard.[21] After his tenure with the band ended in 1950, Little Richard began performing for various vaudeville groups, including Sugarfoot Sam from Alabam, the Tidy Jolly Steppers, the King Brothers Circus and Broadway Follies, earning a reputation as a drag performer.[22] About this time, Little Richard began listening more to R&B and frequented Atlanta clubs, where he witnessed Roy Brown and Billy Wright. Heavily influenced by Wright\\'s flamboyant persona and showmanship, Little Richard began performing as a solo artist on the Chitlin Circuit.[23] Little Richard gained notoriety for high-energy onstage antics during live performances.[24] He eventually befriended Wright during an Atlanta performance in 1950.[25]In 1951, Wright put Little Richard in contact with his manager, Zenas Sears, a local deejay. Sears recorded Little Richard at his station, backed by Wright\\'s band. The recordings led to a contract that year with RCA Victor.[26] Little Richard recorded a total of eight sides for RCA, including the blues ballad, \"Every Hour,\" which became his first single and a hit in Georgia.[26] The release of \"Every Hour\" improved his relationship with his father, who began regularly playing the song on his nightclub jukebox.[26] After its release, Little Richard fronted Perry Welch and His Orchestra, playing at clubs and army bases for $100 a week.[27] Little Richard learned how to play boogie-woogie piano from teenage musician Esquerita around this time.[28] Little Richard left RCA Victor in February 1952 after his records failed to catch on. That same month, his father was killed after a confrontation outside his club. Little Richard, struggling with poverty, settled for work as a dishwasher for Greyhound Lines and hired Clint Brantley as his manager.[29] He formed a band called the Tempo Toppers that year and began to perform as part of blues package tours in clubs across the south, such as Club Tijuana in New Orleans and Club Matinee in Houston.[30][31] With the Tempo Toppers, Little Richard signed with Don Robey\\'s Peacock Records in February 1953, recording eight sides, including four with Johnny Otis and his band that were unreleased at the time.[32] [33] Little Richard had a contentious relationship with Robey and soon found himself disenchanted with the record business and with his group, leaving Peacock and disbanding the Tempo Toppers. That same year, Little Richard formed a hard-driving R&B band, the Upsetters, which included drummer Charles Connor and saxophonist Wilbert \"Lee Diamond\" Smith and toured under Brantley\\'s management.[34][35][36] The Upsetters began to tour successfully, even without a bass player, forcing drummer Connor to thump \"real hard\" on his bass drum in order to get a \"bass fiddle effect.\"[34]At the suggestion of Lloyd Price, Little Richard sent a two-song demo to Price\\'s label, Specialty Records, in February 1955. Time passed before Little Richard got a call to record for the label.[37] Art Rupe, owner of Specialty Records, loaned Little Richard money to buy out his Peacock contract and set him up to work with producer Robert \"Bumps\" Blackwell.[38] Upon hearing the demo, Blackwell felt Little Richard was Specialty\\'s answer to Ray Charles. Little Richard told Blackwell he preferred the sound of Fats Domino. As a result, Little Richard began recording at Cosimo Matassa\\'s J&M Studios in New Orleans that September, recording there with several of Domino\\'s session musicians, including drummer Earl Palmer and saxophonist Lee Allen.[39] The initial cuts failed to produce anything that would inspire huge sales, and Little Richard and his producer took a break at a club called the Dew Drop Inn. While there, Little Richard performed a risqué song he had improvised from his days on the club circuit called \"Tutti Frutti\".[40] The song\\'s a cappella introduction was based on a drum rhythm Little Richard had devised. Blackwell felt the song had hit potential and hired songwriter Dorothy LaBostrie to replace some of Little Richard\\'s sexual lyrics with less controversial words.[41][42] Recorded in three takes in September 1955, \"Tutti Frutti\" was released as a single in November.[43]A lot of songs I sang to crowds first to watch their reaction. That\\'s how I knew they\\'d hit.\"Tutti Frutti\" became an instant hit, reaching No. 2 on Billboard magazine\\'s Rhythm and Blues Best-Sellers chart and crossing over to the pop charts in both the United States and overseas in the United Kingdom. It reached No. 17 on the Billboard Top 100 in America and No. 29 on the British singles chart, eventually selling a million copies.[24][45]Little Richard\\'s next hit single, \"Long Tall Sally\" (1956), became his first to reach No. 1 on the R&B chart and the first to reach the top ten of the pop charts in both America and Britain. Like \"Tutti Frutti\", it sold over a million copies. Following his success, Little Richard built up his backup band, The Upsetters, with the addition of saxophonists Clifford \"Gene\" Burks and leader Grady Gaines, bassist Olsie \"Baysee\" Robinson and guitarist Nathaniel \"Buster\" Douglas.[46] Little Richard began performing on package tours across the United States, often appearing last, where he would steal the show. Art Rupe described the differences between Little Richard and a similar hitmaker of the early rock and roll period by stating that, while \"the similarities between Little Richard and Fats Domino for recording purposes were close\", Little Richard would sometimes stand up at the piano while he was recording and that onstage, where Domino was \"plodding, very slow\", Little Richard was \"very dynamic, completely uninhibited, unpredictable, wild. So the band took on the ambience of the vocalist.\"[47]During a period of racial tension in the United States, Little Richard attracted mixed-race audiences at a time when public places were divided into \"white\" and \"colored\" domains. H.B. Barnum later explained that Little Richard \"opened the door. He brought the races together\".[48] Prior to Little Richard, audiences in musical shows were either \"all black or all white and no one else could come in.\"[48] Little Richard\\'s success enabled audiences of both races to enter the building, albeit still segregated (e.g. blacks on the balcony and whites on the main floor). By the end of Little Richard\\'s performances, however, the audiences would come together to dance.[49] Despite broadcasts on TV from local supremacist groups such as the North Alabama White Citizens Council warning that rock and roll \"brings the races together,\" Little Richard\\'s popularity was helping to shatter the myth that black performers could not successfully perform at \"white-only venues,\" especially in the South where racism was most overt.[50]Little Richard\\'s show, according to Barnum, was the first rock and roll show to use spotlights and flicker lights, which had been a show business tradition, accentuating Little Richard\\'s innovative use of colorful capes, blouse shirts, makeup and suits studded with multi-colored precious stones and sequins.[51] Little Richard\\'s onstage antics often included running on and off the stage, lifting his leg while playing his piano, and jumping up and down onstage and atop the piano, bringing audiences into a frenzy.[52]Fans reacted in similar and sometimes extreme ways. During Little Richard\\'s show at Baltimore\\'s Royal Theatre in June 1956, several fans had to be restrained from jumping off the balcony. Cops stopped the show twice to prevent fans who had rushed the stage from ripping souvenirs off of Little Richard.[53] During the same show, a woman threw a pair of her undergarments onstage at Little Richard, leading other female fans to repeat the action.[53]Little Richard had nine hits in the US in 1956 and five in Britain, with recordings such as \"Slippin\\' and Slidin\\'\", \"Rip It Up\", \"Ready Teddy\", \"The Girl Can\\'t Help It\" and \"Lucille\". Most of Little Richard\\'s earlier hits inspired covers by the likes of Pat Boone, Elvis Presley and Bill Haley. Described as having \"electrifying movie-star looks\", Little Richard accepted brief roles in movies such as Don\\'t Knock the Rock, Mister Rock and Roll and The Girl Can\\'t Help It.[54] His success continued in 1957 with international hits such as \"Jenny, Jenny\" and \"Keep A-Knockin\\'\". Little Richard scored further hit singles such as \"Good Golly, Miss Molly\", eventually scoring 18 hit singles in less than three years.[55][56]Little Richard\\'s success made him a millionaire and, in late 1956, he settled in Los Angeles, purchasing a mansion in a wealthy section of the city, where he lived next door to boxer Joe Louis.[57] In May 1957, Specialty Records released Little Richard\\'s first album, which contained six single recordings that had already been hits on the charts.[58] Here\\'s Little Richard, which reached No. 13 on the Billboard Top LPs chart, then a rare feat for a rock and roll artist.In October 1957, Little Richard embarked on a package tour in Australia with Gene Vincent and Eddie Cochran. During the middle of the tour, he shocked the public by announcing his decision to follow a life in the ministry.[59] Little Richard later explained that during a flight from Melbourne to Sydney that he had seen the plane\\'s red hot engines and felt angels were holding it up.[60] During the Sydney performance, Little Richard saw a bright red fireball flying across the sky above him and was deeply shaken.[60] He took the event, later revealed as the launching of the first artificial Earth satellite Sputnik 1, as a sign from God to repent from performing secular music and his wild lifestyle and enter the ministry.[59] Returning to the states ten days early, Little Richard later learned that his original return flight had crashed into the Pacific Ocean solidifying his belief he was doing as God wanted.[61] After a performance at the Apollo Theater and a recording session with Specialty later that month, Little Richard enrolled at Oakwood College in Huntsville, Alabama, to study theology.[62][63] Fueling his decision to leave the music business was Little Richard\\'s feeling that he hadn\\'t received proper remuneration from Specialty.[64] Upon ending his contract with Specialty in 1959, Little Richard reluctantly agreed to relinquish any royalties for his material.[65] In 1958, he formed the Little Richard Evangelistic Team, traveling across the country to preach.[66] A month after his conversion, while speaking at an evangelical convention in November 1957, Little Richard met Ernestine Campbell, a secretary from Washington, D.C. He married her on July 11, 1959.[67]Around this time, Little Richard began recording gospel for George Goldner\\'s End Records, traveling to New York City to record 19 traditional gospel tunes (one a new song written by Maybelle Jackson called \"I\\'m Quitting Show Business \"), yielding a couple of singles and a barrage of low budget albums . He signed with Mercury Records and had some chart success with songs such as \"He\\'s Not Just a Soldier\" and \"He Got What He Wanted\", which reached the top 40 in the UK.[68]Childhood heroine Mahalia Jackson acknowledged his gospel efforts after hearing him sing in the early 1960s at Mount Moriah Baptist Church in Los Angeles.[69] After working with Little Richard on the Mercury album King of the Gospel Singers, Quincy Jones remarked in 1984 that his performance in the studio impressed him more than any other artist with whom he had worked.[70]I heard so much about the audience reaction, I thought there must be some exaggeration. But it was all true. He drove the whole house into a complete frenzy\\xa0... I couldn\\'t believe the power of Little Richard onstage. He was amazing.In 1962, concert promoter Don Arden persuaded Little Richard to tour Europe after telling him his records were still selling well there. Arden booked him as the headline artist, with Sam Cooke second on the bill.[72] Little Richard, thinking it was a gospel tour, performed gospel material at the first show and received a tepid response (Cooke did not open that show, as he was delayed in arriving). After Cooke opened the second show, with vigorous applause from the crowd, Little Richard and his organist Billy Preston warmed up in darkness before launching into \"Long Tall Sally\", resulting in hysterical responses. Little Richard\\'s shows received similar responses wherever he performed, including a show at Mansfield\\'s Granada Theatre, which closed early after fans rushed the stage.[73] Wanting to capitalize on these headline-grabbing performances, Brian Epstein, the manager of the Beatles, asked Little Richard and Arden to allow his newly recorded band to open for Little Richard on some tour dates, to which they agreed. The first show for which the Beatles opened was at New Brighton\\'s Tower Ballroom that October.[74] The following month, they opened for Little Richard at the Star Club in Hamburg.[75] During this time, Little Richard advised the group on how to perform his songs and taught Paul McCartney his distinctive vocalizations.[75] Back in the U.S., Little Richard recorded six rock and roll songs with the Upsetters for Little Star Records, under the name \"World Famous Upsetters\", allowing him to keep his options open in the ministry.Little Richard returned to the UK the following fall, with The Rolling Stones as openers.[76] At the end of that tour, he starred in his own special, The Little Richard Spectacular, for Granada Television. The special became a ratings success and was rebroadcast twice, after over 60,000 fan letters had been received. Footage of the special was shown around the world, highlighting the frenzy associated with rock and roll.[77] In 1964, Little Richard returned briefly to Specialty and recorded five songs, including the charted single, \"Bama Lama Bama Loo\", which reached the top 20 in the UK but only number 82 in the US.[78] Later that year, he signed with Vee-Jay Records and issued the album Little Richard Is Back. The album failed to catch on domestically, despite a televised performance of the single \"Whole Lotta Shakin\\' Goin\\' On\" on Shindig! that drew wild responses from audience members. By September 1964, Jimi Hendrix, known to Richard as Maurice James, had joined the Upsetters band, as a full member.[79][80] In December, Jimi and some \\'50s band members joined Richard in New York for a session of remakes. The most successful collaboration between Little Richard and Hendrix came in the following year, also in New York, when Hendrix, Billy Preston, and Little Richard recorded the soul ballad \"I Don\\'t Know What You\\'ve Got (But It\\'s Got Me)\", which became a number 12 R&B hit.[81][nb 1] Little Richard and Hendrix clashed over tardiness, wardrobe and Hendrix\\'s stage antics, and as a result, in July 1965, Little Richard\\'s brother Robert fired Hendrix.[83] That same year, Little Richard attempted to set up his own record label but only cut two unreleased tracks. Instead he signed with Modern Records, which resulted in a very agreeable string of rock and soul singles but yielded just one chart-maker, \"Do You Feel It?\". He left that label in early 1966 for Okeh Records. Okeh paired Little Richard musically with his friend from the mid-1950s, Larry Williams, who produced two albums for him in 1966 and 1967; the first being a studio album, The Explosive Little Richard, which generated the modest hit singles \"Poor Dog\" and \"Commandments of Love\",plus an acclaimed non charter, \"(You\\'re My Girl) I don\\'t want to Discuss It\", fully contemporary in the upbeat Motown style, later covered by Delaney and Bonnie, Rhinoceros, and Rod Stewart\\xa0; and the second, Little Richard\\'s Greatest Hits: Recorded Live!, decried by the man himself but which returned him to the pop album charts for the first time in ten years and also hit number 28 on the Hot R&B LPs chart.[84][85][86] Williams also acted as the music director for Little Richard\\'s live performances at the Okeh Club in Los Angeles amid the Okeh period, during which time the demand for Little Richard\\'s appearances increased greatly.[87] Leaving Okeh in late 1967, Little Richard briefly recorded with Brunswick but left shortly after his final session.Little Richard struggled when he returned to secular music in the 1960s. He often complained to producers in the 1960s that he felt unappreciated as producers pushed him towards a horn-oriented Motown sound and felt he wasn\\'t treated with appropriate respect.[88] Little Richard often performed in dingy clubs and lounges with little support from his label. Little Richard adapted a wilder flamboyant and androgynous image that, while a hit with club audiences, was a problem for labels attempting to promote him to conservative R&B buyers.[89] Angered by his decision to \"backslide\" from his ministry, clergymen in the South forced radio disk jockeys to ignore Little Richard\\'s work.[90] His insistence on performing in front of mixed audiences prevented him from receiving radio time in the areas of Los Angeles affected by the Watts riots.[91] Despite recording and public relations struggles, according to his Songwriters Hall of Fame biography, he had sold over 32 million records worldwide by 1968.[92] Focusing on live performances rather than recordings at the end of the 1960s, Little Richard found success with performances in casinos, resorts, and rock and roll festivals in Vancouver, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Boston, Detroit, and New York City. Little Richard returned to the national spotlight in 1969 as a performer at the Atlantic City Pop Festival, where he stole the show from top performers such as Janis Joplin; he did the same to headliner John Lennon at the Toronto Pop Festival. These successes brought Little Richard to talk shows such as the Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson and the Dick Cavett Show, making him a major celebrity again.[93]Little Richard signed with Reprise Records in 1970, releasing the album The Rill Thing, which included the chart-making singles \"Freedom Blues\" and \"Greenwood, Mississippi\". His follow-ups for Reprise failed to produce similar success, and He spent much of the decade performing as a guest instrumentalist / vocalist on sessions with rockers such as Delaney and Bonnie, Joey Covington and Joe Walsh. The sessions for Canned Heat\\'s \"Rockin\\' with the King\" (1972) and Bachman-Turner Overdrive\\'s \"Take It Like a Man\" (1976) resulted in chart successes. Little Richard and three of his brothers formed a management company, Bud Hole Incorporated, around this time.[94] In 1973, Richard made a spectacular contribution to the critically acclaimed documentary \"Let The Good Times Roll\", and he was given a full album side in a two-disc soundtrack album from the film, which charted. Leaving Reprise, that same year, he charted for independent labels, including Green Mountain Records, for which he recorded \"In the Middle of the Night\"; the proceeds were donated to victims charity of tornadoes that had caused damage in 12 states.[95] In 1976, the Mainstream Records single \"Call My Name\" was distributed by Motown but never got past regional hit status. That same year, Little Richard re-recorded 18 of his classic hits in Nashville for K-Tel Records, in high tech. stereo recreations, with a single featuring new versions of \"Good Golly Miss Molly\" and \"Rip It Up\" reaching the UK singles chart.[96] Following over five years of drug and alcohol abuse and a string of recent personal tragedies, Little Richard quit rock and roll music again in 1977 and returned to evangelism, releasing one gospel album, God\\'s Beautiful City, in 1979.[97]In 1984, Little Richard filed a $112\\xa0million lawsuit against Specialty Records; Art Rupe and his publishing company, Venice Music; and ATV Music for not paying royalties to him after he left the label in 1959.[98] The suit was settled out of court in 1986.[99] According to some reports, Michael Jackson gave Little Richard monetary compensation from his work when he co-owned (with Sony-ATV) songs by the Beatles and Little Richard.[100] In 1985, Charles White released Little Richard\\'s authorized biography, Quasar of Rock: The Life and Times of Little Richard, which returned Little Richard to the spotlight.[101] Little Richard returned to show business in what Rolling Stone would refer to as a \"formidable comeback\" following the book\\'s release.[101]Reconciling his roles as evangelist and rock and roll musician for the first time, Little Richard stated that the genre could be used for good or evil.[102] After accepting a role in the film Down and Out in Beverly Hills, Little Richard and Billy Preston penned the faith-based rock and roll song \"Great Gosh A\\'Mighty\" for its soundtrack.[102] Little Richard won critical acclaim for his film role, and the song found success on the American and British charts.[102] The hit led to the release of the album Lifetime Friend (1986) on Warner Bros. Records, with songs deemed \"messages in rhythm\", including a gospel rap track.[103] In addition to a version of \"Great Gosh A\\'Mighty\", cut in England, the album featured two singles that charted in the UK, \"Somebody\\'s Comin\\'\" and \"Operator\". Little Richard spent much of the rest of the decade as a guest on TV shows and appearing in films, winning new fans with what was referred to as his \"unique comedic timing\".[104] In 1989, Little Richard provided rhythmic preaching and background vocals on the extended live version of the U2–B.B. King hit \"When Love Comes to Town\". That same year, Little Richard returned to singing his classic hits following a performance of \"Lucille\" at an AIDS benefit concert.[105]In 1990, Little Richard contributed a spoken-word rap on Living Colour\\'s hit song, \"Elvis Is Dead\", from their album Time\\'s Up.[106][107] The following year, he was one of the featured performers on the hit single and video \"Voices That Care\" that was produced to help boost the morale of U.S. troops involved in Operation Desert Storm. He also recorded a rock and roll version of \"The Itsy Bitsy Spider\" that year that led to a deal with Disney Records, resulting in the release of a hit 1992 children\\'s album, Shake It All About. Throughout the 1990s, Little Richard performed around the world and appeared on TV, film, and tracks with other artists, including Jon Bon Jovi, Elton John and Solomon Burke. In 1992, yet another album of remakes was released, this time with Richard and Japanese guitar hero, Takanaka. Included in the band were swamp guitarist Travis Wammack and his drummer son Monkee, members of Richard\\'s then current touring band.[citation needed]In 2000, Little Richard\\'s life was dramatized for the biographical film Little Richard, which focused on his early years, including his heyday, his religious conversion and his return to secular music in the early 1960s. Little Richard was played by Leon, who earned an NAACP Image Award nomination for his performance in this role. In 2002, Little Richard contributed to the Johnny Cash tribute album, Kindred Spirits: A Tribute to the Songs of Johnny Cash. In 2006, Little Richard was featured in a popular advertisement for the GEICO brand.[108] A 2005 recording of his duet vocals with Jerry Lee Lewis on a cover of the Beatles\\' \"I Saw Her Standing There\" was included on Lewis\\'s 2006 album, Last Man Standing. The same year, Little Richard was a guest judge on the TV series Celebrity Duets. Little Richard and Lewis performed alongside John Fogerty at the 2008 Grammy Awards in a tribute to the two artists considered to be cornerstones of rock and roll by the NARAS. That same year, Little Richard appeared on radio host Don Imus\\' benefit album for sick children, The Imus Ranch Record.[109] In June 2010, Little Richard recorded a gospel track for an upcoming tribute album to songwriting legend Dottie Rambo.Towards the end of the first decade of the new millennium, Rolling Stone reported that Little Richard remained \"one of the most recognized and quotable celebrities in the world.\"[110] Throughout the decade, he kept up a stringent touring schedule, performing primarily in the United States and Europe. However, sciatic nerve pain in his left leg and then replacement of the involved hip began affecting the frequency of his performances by 2010. Despite his health problems, Little Richard continued to receive critical acclaim for his performances. Rolling Stone reported that at a performance at the Howard Theater in Washington, D.C., in June 2012, Little Richard was \"still full of fire, still a master showman, his voice still loaded with deep gospel and raunchy power.\"[111] Little Richard performed a full 90-minute show at the Pensacola Interstate Fair in Pensacola, Florida, in October 2012, at the age of 79, and headlined at the Orleans Hotel in Las Vegas during Viva Las Vegas Rockabilly Weekend in March 2013.[112][113]In 2014, actor Brandon Mychal Smith won critical acclaim for his portrayal of Little Richard in the James Brown biographical drama film Get on Up.[114][115][116] Mick Jagger co-produced the motion picture.[117][118] In June 2015, Little Richard appeared before a paying audience, clad in sparkly boots and a brightly colored jacket at the Wildhorse Saloon in Nashville to receive the Rhapsody & Rhythm Award from and raise funds for the National Museum of African American Music. It was reported that he charmed the crowd by reminiscing about his early days working in Nashville nightclubs.[119][120] In May 2016, the National Museum of African American Music issued a press release indicating that Little Richard was one of the key artists and music industry leaders that attended its 3rd annual My Music Matters Legends Luncheon in Nashville honoring Shirley Caesar, Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff with Rhapsody & Rhythm Awards.[121]Around 1956, Little Richard got involved with Audrey Robinson, a college student, originally from Savannah, Georgia.[122][123][124] According to the singer, he invited other men to have sex with her in groups and once invited Buddy Holly to have sex with her; Robinson denied those claims.[122][125] After Richard\\'s religious conversion, the two friends lost contact. Robinson later became a stripper using the name Lee Angel. After reconnecting with Richard in the 1960s, Robinson feared being close to Richard again, due to their contrasting lifestyles.[126] Robinson and Little Richard have remained close friends.[105]Little Richard met his only wife, Ernestine Campbell, at an evangelical rally in October 1957. They began dating that year and wed in July 1959. According to Campbell, she and Little Richard initially enjoyed a happy marriage with \"normal\" sexual relations. Campbell claimed when the marriage ended in divorce in 1963, it was due to Little Richard\\'s celebrity status, noting that it had made life difficult for her. Little Richard claimed the marriage fell apart due to him being a neglectful husband and his sexuality.[127] Richard claimed that neither Robinson nor Campbell thought he was gay because he was \"such a pumper in those days\".[127] While married, in 1962, Little Richard adopted a one-year-old boy, Danny Jones, from a late church associate.[122] Little Richard and his son remain close, with Jones often acting as one of his bodyguards.[128]Little Richard stated that as a child, he only played with girls and felt feminine, which was the source of jokes and homophobic ridicule at his expense.[129] Caught wearing his mother\\'s makeup and wardrobe at times, he was brutally punished by his father.[130] He began having sexual encounters with boys by his teen years and also occasionally had sex with older women.[131] Because of his effeminate mannerisms, his father kicked him out of their family home at 15.[3] As Richard later explained in 2010, \"my daddy put me out of the house. He said he wanted seven boys, and I had spoiled it, because I was gay.\"[132] He first became involved in voyeurism in his early twenties, when a female friend would drive him around and pick up men who would allow him to watch them have sex in the backseat of cars. He was once arrested after a gas station attendant in Macon reported sexual activity in a car featuring Little Richard and a couple. Cited on a sexual misconduct charge, he spent three days in jail and was temporarily banned from performing in Macon, Georgia.[133]During the early 1950s, Little Richard had appeared as a drag performer in various vaudeville groups. By the time he entered the Chitlin Circuit, he began using makeup regularly, influenced by Billy Wright, who recommended his brand of makeup to him, Pancake 31.[25] Later, as he began experiencing success in the mid-1950s, he made members of his band use makeup as a means to gain entry into white clubs during performances. He later told a columnist, \"I wore the make-up so that white men wouldn\\'t think I was after the white girls. It made things easier for me, plus it was colorful too.\"[134] In 2000, Richard told JET, \"I figure if being called a sissy would make me famous, let them say what they want to.\"[135] Though he was gay, Little Richard recalled female fans sending him naked photos and their phone numbers.[136][137]While attending Oakwood College, Richard recalled a male student showed himself to him. After the incident was reported to the student\\'s father, Little Richard withdrew from the college.[138] In 1962, he was again arrested after he was caught spying on men urinating at men\\'s toilets at a Trailways bus station in Long Beach, California.[139] Richard returned to participating in sexual orgies after his return to secular music in the 1960s. In 1984, while he claimed homosexuality was \"unnatural\" and \"contagious\", he would tell Charles White that he was \"omnisexual\" after he was asked about his sex life.[140] In 1995, Little Richard told Penthouse that he always knew he was gay, saying \"I\\'ve been gay all my life\".[122]Little Richard was allegedly a heavy drinker and cigarette smoker during the mid-1960s. By 1972, he was using cocaine, developing an addiction to the drug. He later lamented during that period, \"they should have called me Little Cocaine, I was sniffing so much of that stuff!\"[141] He got addicted to heroin and PCP around that same period. Of his drug experiences, he said \"I lost my reasoning\".[142] He said of his cocaine addiction that he did whatever he could to use cocaine.[143] Little Richard admitted that his addiction to cocaine and heroin was costing him as much as $1,000 a day.[144] In 1977, longtime friend Larry Williams once showed up with a gun and threatened to kill Little Richard for failing to pay his drug debt. Little Richard later mentioned that this was the most fearful moment of his life because Williams\\'s own drug addiction made him wildly unpredictable. Little Richard did, however, also acknowledge that he and Williams were \"very close friends\" and when reminiscing of the drug-fueled clash, he recalled thinking \"I knew he loved me – I hoped he did.\"[145] Within that same year, Little Richard had several devastating personal experiences, including his brother Tony\\'s death of a heart attack, the accidental shooting of his nephew that he loved like a son, and the murder of two close personal friends – one a valet at \"the heroin man\\'s house.\"[144] The combination of these experiences convinced Little Richard to give up drugs and alcohol, along with rock and roll, and return to the ministry.[146]Little Richard\\'s family had deep evangelical (Baptist and African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME)) Christian roots, including two uncles and a grandfather who were preachers.[12] Little Richard also took part in Macon\\'s Pentecostal churches, which were his favorites mainly due to their music, charismatic praise, dancing in the Holy Spirit and speaking in tongues.[9] At age 10, influenced by Pentecostalism, Little Richard would go around saying he was a faith healer, singing gospel music to people who were feeling sick and touching them. He later recalled that they would often indicate that they felt better after he prayed for them and would sometimes give him money.[9] Little Richard had aspirations of being a preacher due to the influence of singing evangelist Brother Joe May.[12]After he was born again in 1957, Little Richard enrolled at Oakwood College in Huntsville, Alabama, a mostly black Seventh-day Adventist college, to study theology. Little Richard returned to secular music in the early 1960s.[147] He was eventually ordained a minister in 1970, and again resumed evangelical activities in 1977. Little Richard represented Memorial Bibles International and sold their Black Heritage Bible, which highlighted the Book\\'s many black characters. As a preacher, Little Richard evangelized in small churches and packed auditoriums of 20,000 or more. His preaching focused on uniting the races and bringing lost souls to repentance through God\\'s love.[148] In 1984, Little Richard\\'s mother, Leva Mae, died following a period of illness. Only a few months prior to her death, Little Richard promised her that he would remain a Christian.[102]During the 1980s and 1990s, Little Richard officiated at celebrity weddings. In 2006, Little Richard wedded twenty couples who won a contest in one ceremony.[149] The musician used his experience and knowledge as a minister and elder statesman of rock and roll to preach at funerals of musical friends such as Wilson Pickett and Ike Turner.[150] At a benefit concert in 2009 to raise funds to help rebuild children\\'s playgrounds destroyed by Hurricane Katrina, Little Richard asked guest of honor Fats Domino to pray with him and others. His assistants handed out inspirational booklets at the concert—a common practice at Little Richard\\'s shows.[151] He somberly told a Howard Theatre, Washington, D.C. audience in June 2012, \"I know this is not Church, but get close to the Lord. The world is getting close to the end. Get close to the Lord.\"[111] In 2013, Little Richard elaborated on his spiritual philosophies, stating \"God talked to me the other night. He said He\\'s getting ready to come. The world\\'s getting ready to end and He\\'s coming, wrapped in flames of fire with a rainbow around his throne.\" Rolling Stone reported his apocalyptic prophesies generated snickers from some audience members as well as cheers of support. Little Richard responded by stating: \"When I talk to you about [Jesus], I\\'m not playing. I\\'m almost 81 years old. Without God, I wouldn\\'t be here.\"[152]In October 1985, Little Richard returned to the United States from England, where he had finished recording his album Lifetime Friend, to film a guest spot on the show, Miami Vice. Following the taping, he accidentally crashed his sports car into a telephone pole in West Hollywood, California. He suffered a broken right leg, broken ribs and head and facial injuries.[153] His recovery from the accident took several months.[153] His accident prevented him from being able to attend the inaugural Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ceremony in January 1986 where he was one of several inductees. He instead supplied a recorded message.[84]In 2007, Little Richard was having problems walking due to sciatica in his left leg, requiring him to use crutches.[154][155] In November 2009, he entered a hospital to have replacement surgery on his left hip. Despite returning to performance the following year, Little Richard\\'s problems with his hip continued and he has since been brought onstage by wheelchair. He has told fans that his surgery has his hip \"breaking inside\" and refuses to have further work on it.On September 30, 2013, he revealed to CeeLo Green at a Recording Academy fundraiser that he had suffered a heart attack at his home the week prior and stated he used aspirin and had his son turn the air conditioner on, which his doctor confirmed had saved his life. Little Richard stated, \"Jesus had something for me. He brought me through\".[152]On April 28, 2016, Little Richard\\'s friend, Bootsy Collins stated on his Facebook page that, \"he is not in the best of health so I ask all the Funkateers to lift him up.\" Reports subsequently began being published on the internet stating that Little Richard was in grave health and that his family were gathering at his bedside. On May 3, 2016, Rolling Stone reported that Little Richard and his lawyer provided a health information update in which Richard stated, \"not only is my family not gathering around me because I\\'m ill, but I\\'m still singing. I don\\'t perform like I used to, but I have my singing voice, I walk around, I had hip surgery a while ago but I\\'m healthy.\\'\" His lawyer also reported: \"He\\'s 83. I don\\'t know how many 83-year-olds still get up and rock it out every week, but in light of the rumors, I wanted to tell you that he\\'s vivacious and conversant about a ton of different things and he\\'s still very active in a daily routine. I used to represent Prince and he just engaged me in all kinds of Prince conversations, calling him a \\'creative genius.\\'\"[156]He claims to be \"the architect of rock and roll\", and history would seem to bear out Little Richard\\'s boast. More than any other performer – save, perhaps, Elvis Presley, Little Richard blew the lid off the Fifties, laying the foundation for rock and roll with his explosive music and charismatic persona. On record, he made spine-tingling rock and roll. His frantically charged piano playing and raspy, shouted vocals on such classics as \"Tutti Frutti\", \"Long Tall Sally\" and \"Good Golly, Miss Molly\" defined the dynamic sound of rock and roll.Little Richard\\'s music and performance style had a pivotal effect on the shape of the sound and style of popular music genres of the 20th century.[24][42][157] As a rock and roll pioneer, Little Richard embodied its spirit more flamboyantly than any other performer.[158] Little Richard\\'s raspy shouting style gave the genre one of its most identifiable and influential vocal sounds and his fusion of boogie-woogie, New Orleans R&B and gospel music blazed its rhythmic trail.[158][159]Combining elements of boogie, gospel, and blues, Little Richard introduced several of rock music\\'s most characteristic musical features, including its loud volume and vocal style emphasizing power, and its distinctive beat and rhythm. He departed from boogie-woogie\\'s shuffle rhythm and introduced a new distinctive rock beat, where the beat division is even at all tempos. He reinforced the new rock rhythm with a two-handed approach, playing patterns with his right hand, with the rhythm typically popping out in the piano\\'s high register. His new rhythm, which he introduced with \"Tutti Frutti\" (1955), became the basis for the standard rock beat, which was later consolidated by Chuck Berry.[160] \"Lucille\" (1957) foreshadowed the rhythmic feel of 1960s classic rock in several ways, including its heavy bassline, slower tempo, strong rock beat played by the entire band, and verse–chorus form similar to blues.[161]Little Richard\\'s voice was able to generate croons, wails, and screams unprecedented in popular music.[24] He was cited by two of soul music\\'s pioneers, Otis Redding and Sam Cooke, as contributing to that genre\\'s early development. Redding stated that most of his music was patterned after Little Richard\\'s and that he had \"done a lot for [him] and [his] soul brothers in the music business.\"[162] Cooke said in 1962 that Little Richard had done \"so much for our music\".[163] Cooke had a top 40 hit in 1963 with his cover of Little Richard\\'s soulful 1956 hit \\'Send Me Some Loving\\'.[164]James Brown said that Little Richard and the Upsetters, including drummer Charles \"Chuck\" Connor, were \"the first to put the funk in rhythm\", with a biographer stating that their music \"spark[ed] the musical transition from fifties rock and roll to sixties funk\".[84][165]Little Richard\\'s hits of the mid-1950s, such as \"Tutti Frutti\", \"Long Tall Sally\", \"Keep A-Knockin\\'\" and \"Good Golly Miss Molly\", were generally characterized by playful lyrics with sexually suggestive connotations.[24] AllMusic writer Richie Unterberger stated that Little Richard \"merged the fire of gospel with New Orleans R&B, pounding the piano and wailing with gleeful abandon\", and that while \"other R&B greats of the early \\'50s had been moving in a similar direction, none of them matched the sheer electricity of Richard\\'s vocals. With his high speed deliveries, ecstatic trills, and the overjoyed force of personality in his singing, he was crucial in upping the voltage from high-powered R&B into the similar, yet different, guise of rock and roll.\"[42] Due to his innovative music and style, he\\'s often widely acknowledged as the \"architect of rock and roll\".[84]Ray Charles introduced him at a concert in 1988 as \"a man that started a kind of music that set the pace for a lot of what\\'s happening today.\"[166] Rock and roll pioneer Bo Diddley called Little Richard \"one of a kind\" and \"a show business genius\" that \"influenced so many in the music business\".[163] Little Richard\\'s contemporaries, including Elvis Presley, Bill Haley, Jerry Lee Lewis, The Everly Brothers, Gene Vincent and Eddie Cochran, all recorded covers of Little Richard\\'s works.[167] Taken by Little Richard\\'s music and style, and personally covering four of Little Richard\\'s tunes on his own two breakthrough albums in 1956, Presley told Little Richard in 1969 that his music was an inspiration to him and that he was \"the greatest\".[168] Pat Boone noted in 1984, \"no one person has been more imitated than Little Richard\".[169] As they wrote about Little Richard for their Man of the Year – Legend category in 2010, GQ magazine stated that Little Richard \"is, without question, the boldest and most influential of the founding fathers of rock\\'n\\'roll\".[140] R&B pioneer Johnny Otis stated that \"Little Richard is twice as valid artistically and important historically as Elvis Presley, the Beatles, and the Rolling Stones put together.\"[163]In addition to his musical style, Little Richard was cited as one of the first crossover black artists, reaching audiences of all races. His music and concerts broke the color line,[170] drawing blacks and whites together despite attempts to sustain segregation. As H.B. Barnum explained in Quasar of Rock, Little Richard \"opened the door. He brought the races together.\" [48] Barnum described Little Richard\\'s music as not being \"boy-meets-girl-girl-meets-boy things, they were fun records, all fun. And they had a lot to say sociologically in our country and the world.\"[51] Barnum also stated that Little Richard\\'s \"charisma was a whole new thing to the music business\", explaining that \"he would burst onto the stage from anywhere, and you wouldn\\'t be able to hear anything but the roar of the audience. He might come out and walk on the piano. He might go out into the audience.\" Barnum also stated that Little Richard was innovative in that he would wear colorful capes, blouse shirts, makeup and suits studded with multi-colored precious stones and sequins, and that he also brought flickering stage lighting from his show business experience into performance venues where rock and roll artists performed.[171] In 2015, the National Museum of African American Music honored Penniman for helping to shatter the color line on the music charts changing American culture forever.[120][172]Little Richard influenced generations of performers across musical genres.[54] James Brown and Otis Redding both idolized Little Richard.[169][173] Brown allegedly came up with the Famous Flames debut hit, \"Please, Please, Please\", after Little Richard had written the words on a napkin.[174][175] Redding started his professional career with Little Richard\\'s band, The Upsetters.[176] He first entered a talent show performing Little Richard\\'s \"Heeby Jeebies\", winning for 15 consecutive weeks.[177] Ike Turner claimed most of Tina Turner\\'s early vocal delivery was based on Little Richard, something Little Richard himself reiterated in the foreword of Turner\\'s biography, King of Rhythm.[178] Bob Dylan first performed covers of Little Richard\\'s songs on piano in high school with his rock and roll group, the Golden Chords; in 1959 when leaving school, he wrote in his yearbook under \"Ambition\": \"to join Little Richard\".[179] Jimi Hendrix was influenced in appearance (clothing and hairstyle/mustache) and sound by Little Richard. He was quoted in 1966 saying, \"I want to do with my guitar what Little Richard does with his voice.\"[180] Others influenced by Little Richard early on in their lives included Bob Seger and John Fogerty.[181][182] Michael Jackson admitted that Little Richard had been a huge influence on him prior to Off the Wall.[183] Rock critics noted similarities between Prince\\'s androgynous look, music and vocal style to Little Richard\\'s.[184][185][186]The origins of Cliff Richard\\'s name change from Harry Webb was seen as a partial tribute to his musical hero Little Richard and singer Rick Richards.[187] Several members of The Beatles were heavily influenced by Little Richard, including Paul McCartney and George Harrison. McCartney idolized Little Richard in school and later used Little Richard\\'s recordings as inspiration for his uptempo rockers, such as \"I\\'m Down.\".[188][189] \"Long Tall Sally\" was the first song McCartney performed in public.[190] McCartney would later state, \"I could do Little Richard\\'s voice, which is a wild, hoarse, screaming thing. It\\'s like an out-of-body experience. You have to leave your current sensibilities and go about a foot above your head to sing it.\"[191] During the Beatles\\' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction, Harrison commented, \"thank you all very much, especially the rock \\'n\\' rollers, an\\' Little Richard there, if it wasn\\'t for (gesturing to Little Richard), it was all his fault, really.\"[192] Upon hearing Little Richard\\'s \"Long Tall Sally\" in 1956, John Lennon later commented that he was so impressed that he \"couldn\\'t speak\".[193] Rolling Stones members Mick Jagger and Keith Richards were also profoundly influenced by Little Richard, with Jagger citing him as his first induction to R&B music and referring to him as \"the originator and my first idol\".[71] Little Richard was an early vocal influence on Rod Stewart.[194] David Bowie called Little Richard his \"inspiration\" stating upon listening to \"Tutti Frutti\" that he \"heard God\".[195][196]After opening for him with his band Bluesology, pianist Reginald Dwight was inspired to be a \"rock and roll piano player\", later changing his name to Elton John.[197] Farrokh Bulsara performed covers of Little Richard\\'s songs as a teen, before finding fame as Freddie Mercury, frontman for Queen.[198] Little Richard was referred to as Lou Reed\\'s rock and roll hero, deriving inspiration from \"the soulful, primal force\" of the sound made by Little Richard and his saxophonist on \"Long Tall Sally.\" Reed later stated, \"I don\\'t know why and I don\\'t care, but I wanted to go to wherever that sound was and make a life.\"[199] Patti Smith said, \"To me, Little Richard was a person that was able to focus a certain physical, anarchistic, and spiritual energy into a form which we call rock \\'n\\' roll\\xa0... I understood it as something that had to do with my future. When I was a little girl, Santa Claus didn\\'t turn me on. Easter Bunny didn\\'t turn me on. God turned me on. Little Richard turned me on.\"[200] The music of Deep Purple and Motörhead was also influenced by Little Richard, as well as that of AC/DC.[201][202] The latter\\'s Bon Scott idolized Little Richard and aspired to sing like him, and Angus Young was first inspired to play guitar after listening to Little Richard\\'s music.[203][204][205][201][202] Later performers such as Mystikal, André \"André 3000\" Benjamin of Outkast and Bruno Mars were cited by critics as having emulated Little Richard\\'s style in their own works. Mystikal\\'s rap vocal delivery was compared to Little Richard\\'s.[206] André 3000\\'s vocals in Outkast\\'s hit, \"Hey Ya!\", were compared to an \"indie rock Little Richard\".[207] Bruno Mars admitted Little Richard was one of his earliest influences.[208] Mars\\' song, \"Runaway Baby\" from his album, Doo-Wops & Hooligans was cited by the New York Times as \"channeling Little Richard\".[209]Little Richard received the Cashbox Triple Crown Award for \"Long Tall Sally\" in 1956.[210] In 1984, he was inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame. He was inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1986, being a member of the initial class of inductees chosen for that honor.[84] In 1990, he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Rhythm and Blues Foundation in 1994.[211] In 1993, he received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.[212] In 1997, he was given the American Music Award of Merit.[213] In 2002, along with Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley, Little Richard was honored as one of the first group of BMI icons at the 50th Annual BMI Pop Awards.[214] That same year, he was inducted into the NAACP Image Award Hall of Fame.[215] A year later, he was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.[92] In 2006, he was inducted into the Apollo Theater Hall of Fame.[216] Four years afterwards, he received a plaque on the theater\\'s Walk of Fame.[217] In 2008, he received a star at Nashville\\'s Music City Walk of Fame.[218] In 2009, he was inducted to the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame.[219] The UK issue of GQ named him its Man of the Year in its Legend category in 2010.[220]Little Richard appeared in person to receive an honorary degree from his hometown\\'s Mercer University on May 11, 2013.[221] The day before the doctorate of humanities degree was to be bestowed upon him, the mayor of Macon announced that one of Little Richard\\'s childhood homes, an historic site, will be moved to a rejuvenated section of that city\\'s Pleasant Hill district. It will be restored and named the Little Richard Penniman – Pleasant Hill Resource House, a meeting place where local history and artifacts will be displayed as provided by residents.[222][223][224] Penniman was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame on May 7, 2015.[225] On June 6, 2015, Penniman was inducted into the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame[226] On June 19, 2015, the National Museum of African American Music honored Penniman with the Rhapsody & Rhythm Award for his key role in the formation of popular music genres, influencing singers and musicians across genres from Rock to Hip-Hop, and helping to shatter the color line on the music charts changing American culture forever.[120][172]In 2010, Time Magazine listed \\'Here\\'s Little Richard\\' as the Number 2 of the 100 Greatest and Most Influential Album of All Time - the highest rock and roll album on the entire list.[58] Included in numerous Rolling Stone lists, Little Richard\\'s Here\\'s Little Richard was ranked fifty on the magazine\\'s list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.[227] He was ranked eighth on its list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.[228] Rolling Stone listed three of Little Richard\\'s recordings, \"The Girl Can\\'t Help It\", \"Long Tall Sally\" and \"Tutti Frutti\", on their 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.[229] Two of the latter songs and \"Good Golly, Miss Molly\" were listed on the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame\\'s 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll.[230] The Grammy Hall of Fame inducted several of Little Richard\\'s recordings including \"Tutti Frutti\", \"Lucille\", \"Long Tall Sally\" and Here\\'s Little Richard.[231] \"Tutti Frutti\" topped music magazine Mojo\\'s list of \"The 100 Records That Changed the World\".[232] The same recording was inducted to the Library of Congress\\' National Recording Registry in 2010, with the library claiming the \"unique vocalizing over the irresistible beat announced a new era in music\".[233]', 'LittleWillieLittlefield': 'Willie Littlefield, Jr.,[2] billed as Little Willie Littlefield (September 16, 1931 – June 23, 2013),[3] was an American R&B and boogie-woogie pianist and singer[4] whose early recordings \"formed a vital link between boogie-woogie and rock and roll\".[4] Littlefield was regarded as a teenage wonder and overnight sensation when in 1949, at the age of 18, he popularized the triplet piano style on his Modern Records debut single, \"It\\'s Midnight\".[5] He also recorded the first version of the song \"Kansas City\" (originally issued as \"K.\\xa0C. Lovin\\'\"), in 1952.Littlefield was born in El Campo, Texas, and grew up in Houston with his mother. By 1947, at the age of sixteen, he was already a local attraction in many of the clubs on Dowling Street in Houston and was recording for Eddie Henry, a local record shop proprietor who ran his own label, Eddie\\'s Records.[6] He formed his first band with the saxophonist Don Wilkerson, a friend from school.[4]Littlefield was strongly influenced by the boogie-woogie pianist Albert Ammons. A particular favourite of his was Ammons\\'s \"Swanee River Boogie\", which he later recorded for Eddie\\'s Records.[6] Other major influences on Littlefield\\'s style were the Texas musicians Charles Brown and Amos Milburn.[3] Littlefield learned most of their \"chops\" and soon developed his own distinctive triplet style, which was widely copied by R&B musicians in the early 1950s, particularly Fats Domino, who incorporated it into his New Orleans rhythm and blues.[6]His first recording, \"Little Willie’s Boogie\", was a hit in Texas in 1949 and brought him to the attention of Jules Bihari, of Modern Records in Los Angeles, who was searching for a performer to rival the success of Amos Milburn.[4] Bihari flew to Houston in July 1949 to investigate the city\\'s black entertainment venues and heard of a \"teenage wonder boy pianist\" who was causing a stir at the Eldorado Ballroom. Bihari went to hear Littlefield and soon arranged for an audition at a local studio. The session was captured on acetate disc, with Bihari, clearly audible in the background, calling for Littlefield to play popular R&B tunes of the day.[6]Back at Modern Records, he recorded \"It\\'s Midnight\", which became a national hit, reaching number three on the Billboard R&B chart, and its follow-up, \"Farewell\", which reached number five.[7] He became a major nightclub attraction and recorded with West Coast musicians such as Maxwell Davis. Don Wilkerson, Littlefield\\'s schoolmate and the leading saxophone player in his band, also travelled to Los Angeles, but Milburn promptly persuaded him to lead Milburn\\'s new band, the Aladdin Chickenshackers.[6]Modern Records booked Littlefield for three recording sessions in October 1949, followed by more sessions over the next two months at Radio Recorders in Hollywood. During these three months alone, over 22 sides were cut – an unusual output compared to that of most other artists, who averaged only two sessions a year. Other musicians at these sessions included the saxophonists Maxwell Davis and Buddy Floyd, the guitarists Chuck Norris and Johnny Moore, and the drummers Al Wichard and Jessie Price.[6] One of his 1950 recordings, \"Happy Pay Day\", written by Jack Holmes, was later rewritten by Holmes with entirely different lyrics as \"The Blacksmith Blues\", which became a hit for Ella Mae Morse.[8][user-generated source]In 1951, his duet with Little Lora Wiggins, \"I\\'ve Been Lost\", reached number 10 on the R&B chart.[7]In 1952 he moved to the Federal subsidiary of King Records. His first session for Federal produced \"K. C. Loving\", written by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller and later re-recorded by Wilbert Harrison as \"Kansas City\".By 1957 Littlefield had moved to northern California and continued to record for Don Barksdale\\'s Rhythm label in San Francisco, for which he produced the single \"Ruby, Ruby\".[6] Littlefield’s recording and his subsequent releases were not successful, but he remained a popular performer in clubs in the San Francisco area.In the late 1970s he toured Europe successfully, settling in the Netherlands and releasing a number of albums from 1982 into the late 1990s for the Oldie Blues label from Martin van Olderen.[9]After touring for more than 50 years, Littlefield stopped in 2000. After five years of retirement in his adopted home country, the Netherlands, he decided to play again, starting in 2006, declaring, \"I went fishing for five years – now I know every herring in Holland by name – it got boring. I feel great and I want to be back with my audience.\"[10]In his later years Littlefield continued to perform occasionally, mainly at festivals, particularly in the UK. In 2008 he played at the 20th Burnley Blues Festival, in 2008, and at the 5th annual UK Boogie Woogie Festival at Sturminster Newton in Dorset, in July 2009. He performed at Shakedown Blues Club, at Castor Hall, near Castor, Peterborough, in 2006 and made a return appearance in October 2010.[11]He died at his home in Voorthuizen, Netherlands, in 2013, at the age of 81. He had cancer.[4]', 'LouisJordan': 'Louis Thomas Jordan[1] (July 8, 1908 – February 4, 1975)[2] was a pioneering American musician, songwriter and bandleader who was popular from the late 1930s to the early 1950s. Known as \"The King of the Jukebox\", he was highly popular with both black and white audiences in the later years of the swing era.Jordan was one of the most successful African-American musicians of the 20th century, ranking fifth in the list of the most successful black recording artists according to Joel Whitburn\\'s analysis of Billboard magazine\\'s R&B chart. Though comprehensive sales figures are not available, he had at least four million-selling hits during his career. Jordan regularly topped the R&B \"race\" charts and was one of the first black recording artists to achieve significant crossover in popularity with the mainstream (predominantly white) American audience, having simultaneous Top Ten hits on the pop charts on several occasions.Jordan was a talented singer with great comedic flair, and he fronted his own band for more than twenty years. He duetted with some of the biggest solo singing stars of his time, including Bing Crosby, Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong. Jordan was also an actor and a major black film personality—he appeared in dozens of \"soundies\" (promotional film clips), made numerous cameos in mainstream features and short films, and starred in two musical feature films made especially for him. He was an instrumentalist who played all forms of the saxophone but specialized in the alto. He also played the piano and clarinet. A productive songwriter, he wrote or co-wrote many songs that were influential classics of 20th-century popular music.Jordan began his career in big-band swing jazz in the 1930s, but he became famous as one of the leading practitioners, innovators and popularizers of jump blues, a swinging, up-tempo, dance-oriented hybrid of jazz, blues and boogie-woogie. Typically performed by smaller bands consisting of five or six players, jump music featured shouted, highly syncopated vocals and earthy, comedic lyrics on contemporary urban themes. It strongly emphasized the rhythm section of piano, bass and drums; after the mid-1940s, this mix was often augmented by electric guitar. Jordan\\'s band also pioneered the use of the electronic organ.With his dynamic Tympany Five bands, Jordan mapped out the main parameters of the classic R&B, urban blues and early rock-and-roll genres with a series of highly influential 78-rpm discs released by Decca Records. These recordings presaged many of the styles of black popular music of the late 1940s, 1950s and 1960s and exerted a strong influence on many leading performers in these genres. Many of his records were produced by Milt Gabler, who went on to refine and develop the qualities of Jordan\\'s recordings in his later production work with Bill Haley, including \"Rock Around the Clock\".Jordan was born on July 8, 1908, in Brinkley, Arkansas, where his father, James Aaron Jordan, was a music teacher and bandleader for the Brinkley Brass Band and for the Rabbit Foot Minstrels. His mother, Adell, died when Louis was young.Jordan studied music under his father, starting out on the clarinet. In his youth he played in his father\\'s bands instead of doing farm work when school closed. He also played the piano professionally early in his career, but alto saxophone became his main instrument. However, he became even better known as a songwriter, entertainer and vocalist.Jordan briefly attended Arkansas Baptist College, in Little Rock, and majored in music. After a period with the Rabbit Foot Minstrels (in which one of his colleagues was Leon \"Pee Wee\" Whittaker)[3] and with local bands, including Bob Alexander\\'s Harmony Kings,[4] he went to Philadelphia and then New York. In 1932, Jordan began performing with the Clarence Williams band, and when he was in Philadelphia he played clarinet in the Charlie Gaines band.In late 1936 he was invited to join the influential Savoy Ballroom orchestra, led by the drummer Chick Webb. Based at New York\\'s Savoy Ballroom, Webb\\'s orchestra was renowned as one of the best big bands of its day and regularly beat all comers at the Savoy\\'s legendary cutting contests. Jordan worked with Webb until 1938, and it proved a vital stepping-stone in his career—Webb (who was physically disabled) was a fine musician but not a great showman. The ebullient Jordan often introduced songs as he began singing lead; he later recalled that many in the audience took him to be the band\\'s leader, which undoubtedly boosted his confidence further. This was the same period when the young Ella Fitzgerald was coming to prominence as the Webb band\\'s lead female vocalist; she and Jordan often sang duets on stage, and they later reprised their partnership on several records, by which time both were major stars.In 1938, Webb fired Jordan for trying to persuade Fitzgerald and others to join his new band. By this time Webb was already seriously ill with tuberculosis of the spine. He died at the age of 34, after spinal surgery on June 16, 1939. Following his death, Fitzgerald took over the band.Jordan\\'s first band, drawn mainly from members of the Jesse Stone band, was originally a nine-piece group, but he soon scaled it down to a sextet after landing a residency at the Elks Rendezvous club, at 464 Lenox Avenue, in Harlem. The original lineup of the sextet was Jordan (saxes, vocals), Courtney Williams (trumpet), Lem Johnson (tenor sax), Clarence Johnson (piano), Charlie Drayton (bass) and Walter Martin (drums). In his first billing, as Louie Jordan\\'s Elks Rendez-vous Band, his name was spelled Louie so people would know not to pronounce it Lewis.[5]The new band\\'s first recording date, for Decca Records on December 20, 1938, produced three sides on which they backed an obscure vocalist, Rodney Sturgess, and two novelty sides of their own, \"Honey in the Bee Ball\" and \"Barnacle Bill the Sailor\". These recordings were credited to the Elks Rendezvous Band, but Jordan subsequently changed the name to the Tympany Five, since Martin often used tympani in performance. (The word tympany is also an old-fashioned colloquial term meaning \"swollen, inflated, puffed-up\", etymologically related to timpani, or kettledrums, but historically separate.)The various lineups of the Tympany Five (which often featured two or three extra players) included Bill Jennings and Carl Hogan on guitar, the renowned pianist-arrangers Wild Bill Davis and Bill Doggett, \"Shadow\" Wilson and Chris Columbus on drums and Dallas Bartley on bass. Jordan played alto, tenor and baritone saxophone and sang the lead vocal on most songs.Their next recording date, in March 1939, produced five sides, including \"Keep a-Knockin\\'\" (originally recorded in the 1920s and later famously covered by Little Richard), \"Sam Jones Done Snagged His Britches\" and \"Doug the Jitterbug\". Lem Johnson subsequently left the group and was replaced by Stafford Simon. Sessions in December 1939 and January 1940 produced two more early Jordan classics, \"You\\'re My Meat\" and \"You Run Your Mouth and I\\'ll Run My Business\". Other musicians who passed through the band in 1940 and 1941 included the tenorist Kenneth Hollon (who recorded with Billie Holiday) and the trumpeter Freddie Webster (from Earl Hines\\'s band), who was part of the nascent bebop scene at Minton\\'s Playhouse and influenced Kenny Dorham and Miles Davis.In 1941 Jordan signed with the General Artists Corporation, and the agency appointed Berle Adams to be his agent. Adams secured an engagement at Chicago\\'s Capitol Lounge, supporting the Mills Brothers, and this proved to be an important breakthrough for Jordan and the band.The Capitol Lounge residency also provides a remarkable yardstick of the scale of Jordan\\'s success. During this engagement, the group was paid the standard union scale of US$70 per week – $35 per week for Jordan and $35 split between the rest of the band. Just seven years later, when Jordan played his record-breaking season at the Golden Gate Theater in San Francisco in 1948, he reportedly grossed over US$70,000 in just two weeks.During this period the bassist Henry Turner was fired and replaced by Dallas Bartley. This was followed by another important engagement, at the Fox Head Tavern, in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Working in the looser environment of Cedar Rapids, away from the main centers, the band was able to develop the novelty aspect of their repertoire and performance. Jordan later identified his stint at the Fox Head Tavern as the turning point in his career. While there he found several songs that became early hits, including \"If It\\'s Love You Want, Baby\", \"Ration Blues\" and \"Inflation Blues\".In April 1941 Decca launched the Sepia Series, a 35-cent line that featured artists who were considered to have the \"crossover potential\" to sell in both the black and white markets. Jordan\\'s band was transferred from Decca\\'s \"race\" label to the Sepia Series, alongs with the Delta Rhythm Boys, the Nat King Cole Trio, Buddy Johnson and the Jay McShann Band.By the time the group returned to New York in late 1941, the lineup had changed to Jordan, Bartley, Martin, the trumpeter Eddie Roane and the pianist Arnold Thomas. Recording dates in November 1941 produced another early Jordan classic, \"Knock Me a Kiss\", which had significant jukebox sales but did not make the charts. However, Roy Eldridge subsequently recorded a version, backed by the Gene Krupa band, which became a hit in June 1942, almost a year after the Jordan recording came out; it was also covered by Jimmie Lunceford.These sessions also produced Jordan\\'s first big-selling record, \"I\\'m Gonna Move to the Outskirts of Town\", originally recorded by Casey Bill Weldon in 1936. It also did not make the charts. It too was covered by Lunceford, in 1942, whose version reached number 12 on the pop chart; it was also covered by Big Bill Broonzy and Jimmy Rushing.Sessions in July 1942 produced nine prime sides, allowing Decca to stockpile Jordan\\'s recordings as a hedge against the recording ban declared by the American Federation of Musicians in the same month. The ban—imposed in order to secure royalty payments for union musicians for each record sold—led to Jordan\\'s enforced absence from the studio for the next year, and it also prevented many seminal bebop performers from recording during one of the most crucial years of the genre\\'s history.\"I\\'m Gonna Leave You on the Outskirts of Town\" was an \"answer record\" to Jordan\\'s earlier \"I\\'m Gonna Move to the Outskirts of Town\". It became Jordan\\'s first major chart hit, reaching number 2 on Billboard\\'s Harlem Hit Parade. His next side, \"What\\'s the Use of Getting Sober (When You\\'re Gonna Get Drunk Again)\", became Jordan\\'s first number 1 hit, reaching the top of the Harlem Hit Parade in December 1942. A subsequent side, \"The Chicks I Pick Are Slender, Tender and Fine\", reached number 10 in January 1943. Their next major side, the comical call-and response number \"Five Guys Named Moe\", was one of the first recordings to solidify the fast-paced, swinging R&B style that became Jordan\\'s signature, and it struck a chord with audiences, reaching number 3 on the race chart in September 1943. The song was later taken as the title of a long-running stage show that paid tribute to Jordan and his music. The more conventional \"That\\'ll Just About Knock Me Out\" also fared well, reaching number 8 on the race chart and giving Jordan his fifth hit from the December 1942 sessions.In late 1942, Jordan and his band relocated to Los Angeles, working at major venues there and in San Diego. While in Los Angeles, Jordan began making \"soundies\", the earliest precursors of the modern music video, and also appeared on many Jubilee radio shows and a series of programs made for the Armed Forces Radio for distribution to American troops overseas. Unlike many musicians, Jordan\\'s career was uninterrupted by the draft, except for a four-week Army camp tour. Because of a \"hernia condition\" he was classified \"4F\".[6]Decca was one of the first labels to reach an agreement with the musicians\\' union, and Jordan returned to recording in October 1943. At this session Jordan and his band recorded \"Ration Blues\", which dated from their Fox Head Tavern days but had a new timeliness with the imposition of wartime rationing. It became Jordan\\'s first crossover hit, charting on both the white and the black pop charts. It was also a huge hit on the Harlem Hit Parade, where it spent six weeks at number 1 and stayed in the Top Ten for a remarkable 21 weeks, and it reached number 11 in the general \"best-sellers\" chart.Within a year of his breakthrough, the Tympany Five\\'s appearance fee rose from $350 to $2,000 per night. But the breadth of Jordan\\'s success and the size of his combo had larger implications for the music industry. The blues singer Gatemouth Moore said, \"He was playing... with five pieces. That ruined the big bands... He could play just as good and just as loud with five as 17. And it was cheaper.\"[7] Jordan\\'s position as the band\\'s lead vocalist was also uncommon and proved influential. The artistic innovations and economic advantages reinforced each other and helped pave the way for black pop music to shift from big-band swing to rock and roll. The word rock, originally black slang for coitus, began to be popularly used in its musical sense in the early 1940s. Following Jordan, many other small bands began achieving success, including Joe Liggins and the Honeydrippers and Johnny Moore\\'s Three Blazers, while single acts such as Big Joe Turner, Ivory Joe Hunter, T-Bone Walker and Wynonie Harris travelled the circuit without bands.In the 1940s, Jordan released dozens of hit songs, including the swinging \"Saturday Night Fish Fry\" (one of the earliest and most powerful contenders for the title of first rock and roll record), \"Blue Light Boogie\", the comic classic \"Ain\\'t Nobody Here but Us Chickens\", \"Buzz Me,\" \"Ain\\'t That Just Like a Woman (They\\'ll Do It Every Time)\", and the multimillion seller \"Choo Choo Ch\\'Boogie\".One of his biggest hits was \"Caldonia\", with its energetic screaming punchline, banged out by the whole band, \"Caldonia! Caldonia! What makes your big head so hard?\" After Jordan\\'s success with it, the song was also recorded by Woody Herman in a famous modern arrangement, including a unison chorus by five trumpets. Muddy Waters also recorded a version. However, many of Jordan\\'s biggest R&B hits were inimitable, and no hit cover versions of them were recorded, a rarity in an era when black pop music was often rerecorded by white artists, and many popular songs were released in multiple competing versions.Jordan\\'s raucous recordings were also notable for their use of fantastical narrative. This is perhaps best exemplified on the freewheeling party adventure \"Saturday Night Fish Fry\", a two-part 1950 hit that was split across both sides of a 78-rpm record. It is arguably[citation needed] one of the earliest American recordings to include all the basic elements of classic rock and roll (obviously exerting a direct influence on the subsequent work of Bill Haley), and it is certainly one of the first widely popular songs to use the word rocking in the chorus and to prominently feature a distorted electric guitar.[8]Its distinctive comical adventure narrative is strikingly similar to the style later used by Bob Dylan in his \"story\" songs, such as \"Bob Dylan\\'s 115th Dream\" and \"Tombstone Blues\".[citation needed] \"Saturday Night Fish Fry\" is also notable for the fact that it dispenses with the customary instrumental chorus introduction, but its most prominent feature is Jordan\\'s rapid-fire, semispoken vocal. His delivery, clearly influenced by his experience as a saxophone soloist, de-emphasizes the vocal melody in favor of highly syncopated phrasing and the percussive effects of alliteration and assonance, and it is arguably one of the earliest examples in American popular music of the vocal stylings that eventually evolved into rap.Jordan\\'s original songs joyously celebrated the ups and downs of African-American urban life and were infused with cheeky good humor and a driving musical energy that had a massive influence on the development of rock and roll. His music was popular with both blacks and whites, but lyrically most of his songs were emphatically and uncompromisingly \"black\" in their content and delivery.Loaded with wry social commentary and coded references, they are also a treasury of 1930s and 1940s black hipster slang. Through his records Jordan was probably one of the main popularizers of the slang term chick (\"woman\"). Sexual themes were often prominently featured, and some sides—notably the saucy double entendre of \"Show Me How to Milk the Cow\"—were so risqué that it seems remarkable that they were issued at all.The prime of Jordan\\'s recording career, 1942–1950, was a period of segregation on the radio. Despite this he had a crossover number 1 single, \"G.I. Jive\" backed with \"Is You Is or Is You Ain\\'t My Baby?\" in 1944, thanks in large part to his performance with his orchestra of the song in the all-star wartime musical film Follow the Boys (Universal Pictures, 1944). Two years later, MGM\\'s cartoon cat Tom sang \"Is You Is or Is You Ain\\'t My Baby?\" in the 1946 Tom and Jerry cartoon short \"Solid Serenade\".[3] Jordan appeared in the 1946 Monogram Pictures movie Swing Parade of 1946 and starred in the 1947 all-black, full-length Astor Pictures film Reet, Petite and Gone.During this period Jordan again placed more than a dozen songs on the national charts. However, Louis Jordan and His Tympany Five dominated the 1940s R&B charts, or (as they were known at the time) the \"race\" charts. In this period Jordan had eighteen number 1 singles and fifty-four in the Top Ten. According to Joel Whitburn\\'s points-based analysis of Billboard chart placings, Jordan ranks fifth among the most successful artists over the period 1942–1995.[9] From July 1946 through May 1947, Jordan had five consecutive number 1 songs, holding the top slot for 44 consecutive weeks.[10]Jordan\\'s popularity was boosted not only by his hit Decca records but also by his prolific recordings for Armed Forces Radio and the V-Disc transcription program, which helped to make him as popular with whites as with blacks. He also starred in a series of short musical films and made numerous \"soundies\" for his hit songs.[11] The ancestor of the modern music video, soundies were short film clips designed for use in audio-visual jukeboxes. These were in addition to his part in Follow the Boys.In 1951, Jordan assembled a short-lived big band that included Pee Wee Moore and others, at a time when big bands were declining in popularity. This is considered the beginning of his commercial decline, even though he reverted to the Tympany Five format within a year. By the mid-1950s, Jordan\\'s records were not selling as well as before, and he left Decca Records.The next label to sign Jordan was Aladdin Records, for which Jordan recorded 21 songs in early 1954. Nine singles were released from these sessions; three of the songs were not released.[12] In 1955, Jordan recorded with RCA\\'s \"independent\" subsidiary \"X\" Records, which changed its name to Vik Records while Jordan was with them.[13] Three singles were released under the \"X\" imprint and one under the Vik imprint; four tracks were not released.[12] In these sessions Jordan intensified his sound to compete with rock and roll.[12]In 1956, Mercury Records signed Jordan and released two LPs and a handful of singles.[12] Jordan\\'s first LP for Mercury, Somebody Up There Digs Me (1956), showcased updated rock-and-roll versions of previous hits such as \"Ain\\'t Nobody Here but Us Chickens\", \"Caldonia\", \"Choo Choo Ch\\'Boogie\", \"Salt Pork, West Virginia\", and \"Beware!\" Its follow-up, Man, We\\'re Wailin\\' (1957), featured a more laid-back, \"late-night\" sound.[12] Mercury intended this to be a comeback for Jordan, but it was not commercially successful, and the label let him go in 1958.[12] He recorded sporadically in the 1960s for Warwick (1960), Black Lion (1962), Tangerine (1962–1965), and Pzazz (1968) and in the early 1970s for Black and Blue (1973), Blues Spectrum (1973), and JSP (1974).[14]In 1962 he appeared on the album Louis Jordan Sings, by the British trumpeter and bandleader Chris Barber. Speaking in 2012, Barber recalled seeing Jordan in the early 1960s at the Apollo Theater in New York, with the intention of bringing him to the UK to record There for the first time:\"playing with him was just frightening. It\\'s a bit like an amateur guitar player from a back street who has just bought a Spanish guitar, working with Segovia. He didn\\'t make you feel small, but he was just so perfect in what he did.\\xa0... I still remember watching him singing, but he would accompany himself on the alto, and you were convinced he was playing the alto while he was singing.\\xa0... the breath hadn\\'t gone from his last word before he was playing his alto and it seemed to be simultaneous.\\xa0... He got a very raw deal from history... In the Chick Webb band there were two regular singers – Ella [Fitzgerald] and Louis Jordan. And yet really history has consigned him to just being a comedy vocal thing with a bit of rock and roll, and the first alto\\xa0... but he was such a consumately good singer that it\\'s sad that he wasn\\'t known more for it.\"[15]During an interview late in life, Jordan made the controversial remark that rock and roll was simply rhythm and blues played by white performers. The link between Jordan\\'s music and rock and roll was later underscored by others, notably Chuck Berry, who acknowledged on The Tonight Show in 1987 that Jordan was his main inspiration; this led to Jordan\\'s induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.Jordan wrote (or co-wrote) a large proportion of the songs he performed, but did not benefit financially from many of them. Many of the hit songs he wrote, including \"Caldonia\", were credited to his wife Fleecie Moore as a means of avoiding an existing publishing arrangement. Their marriage was acrimonious and short-lived. On two occasions, Moore stabbed Jordan after domestic disputes, almost killing him the second time. After their divorce she retained ownership of the songs. However, Jordan may have taken credit for some songs written by others—he is credited as the co-writer of \"Saturday Night Fish Fry\", but the Tympany Five pianist Bill Doggett later claimed that in fact he had written the song.[16]In addition to singing in many films and appearing in mainstream films such as Meet Miss Bobby Sox (1944) and Follow the Boys (1944), Jordan starred in several race films: Beware! (1946), Reet, Petite, and Gone (1947), and Look-Out Sister (1947).[17]His prolific use of film as a promotional vehicle broke new ground, garnering admiration from the trade press, including Billboard, which gushed, \"The movies have helped the one-nighters, which have also been helped by recordings, which have also helped the movies, which in turn have become more profitable. It\\'s a delicious circle, and other bands are now exploring the possibilities.\"[18]Jordan is believed[by whom?] to have been married five times. His first wife was named Julia or Julie. By 1932 he was married to Ida Fields, a Texas singer and dancer. He and Fields divorced. In 1942 he married his childhood sweetheart, Fleecie Moore; they were later divorced. He married Vicky Hayes, a dancer, in 1951; they separated in 1960. He married Martha Weaver, a singer and dancer, in 1966.[4]Jordan died of a heart attack on February 4, 1975, in Los Angeles.[19] He is buried at Mt. Olive Cemetery in St. Louis, Missouri, the hometown of his wife Martha.Jordan is described by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as \"the Father of Rhythm & Blues\" and \"the Grandfather of Rock \\'n’ Roll.\"[20] He is one of a number of seminal black performers who are often credited with inventing rock and roll, or at least providing many of the building blocks of the music. Jordan was the greatest postwar exponent of the jump blues style, one of the prototypes of rock and roll, and he paved the way for Roy Brown, Wynonie Harris, Tiny Bradshaw and others. Jordan also strongly influenced Bill Haley & His Comets, whose producer, Milt Gabler, had also worked with Jordan and attempted to incorporate Jordan\\'s stylings into Haley\\'s music. Haley also honored Jordan by recording several of his songs, including \"Choo Choo Ch\\'Boogie\" (which Gabler co-wrote) and \"Caldonia\".Among Jordan\\'s biggest fans were Berry and Little Richard.[citation needed] Some have suggested that Berry modeled his musical approach on Jordan\\'s, changing the lyric content from black life to teenage life, and substituting cars and girls for Jordan\\'s primary motifs of food, drink, money and girls. Berry\\'s iconic opening riff on \"Johnny B. Goode\" bears a striking similarity to the intro played by the guitarist Carl Hogan on the 1946 hit \"Ain\\'t That Just Like a Woman\"; Berry has acknowledged the debt in interviews[21][22][23] Jordan was also an obvious and substantial influence on the British-based jump blues exponent Ray Ellington, who became famous through his appearances on The Goon Show.James Brown has also specifically cited Jordan as a major influence because of his multifaceted talent. In the 1992 documentary Lenny Henry Hunts the Funk, Brown said that Jordan had influenced him \"in every way. He could sing, he could dance, he could play, he could act. He could do it all.\"Others[who?] have suggested Jordan\\'s vocal style may have been an important precursor of rap.[citation needed] His 1947 sister tracks, \"Beware (Brother Beware)\" and \"Look Out (Sister)\", entirely delivered as spoken rhyming couplets, can arguably be classified as one of the first true \"raps\" in popular music. \"Saturday Night Fish Fry\" (1950) also features a rapid-fire, highly syncopated semispoken vocal delivery that bears some resemblance to the modern rap style.The United States Postal Service featured Jordan and his film for \"Caldonia\" in 2008 as part of its tribute to Vintage Black Cinema. \"Vivid reminders of a bygone era will be celebrated in June through Vintage Black Cinema stamps based on five vintage movie posters. Whether spotlighting the talents of entertainment icons or documenting changing social attitudes and expectations, these posters now serve a greater purpose than publicity and promotion. They are invaluable pieces of history, preserving memories of cultural phenomena that otherwise might have been forgotten. The stamp pane was designed by Carl Herrman of Carlsbad, California.\"[24]The Broadway show Five Guys Named Moe was devoted to Jordan\\'s music, and this title was given to both the soundtrack (tribute) album and original music collections.B. B. King recorded an album called Let The Good Times Roll: The Music of Louis Jordan and the songs \"Let the Good Times Roll\" and \"Caldonia\".David Bromberg featured a version of \"Beware, Brother Beware\" on his 1977 release, Reckless Abandon.The rock singer Joe Jackson recorded Jumpin\\' Jive in 1981, which featured several songs by Jordan.Let the Good Times Roll, a biography of Jordan by the British jazz historian John Chilton, was published by the University of Michigan Press in 1997.On June 23, 2008 the United States House of Representatives passed a resolution introduced by Arkansas Representative Vic Snyder honoring Jordan on the centenary of his birth.[25]The ska punk band Streetlight Manifesto covered his song \"The Troubadour (Poor Willie)\" on their album 99 Songs of Revolution: Volume 1, released on March 16, 2010.[26]The American swing-ska band the Cherry Poppin\\' Daddies covered his song \"Doug the Jitterbug\" for their 2013 album, White Teeth, Black Thoughts.', 'LucaSestak': 'Luca Sestak (born January 10, 1995 in Celle, Germany) is a German boogie-woogie, blues and jazz pianist and composer.Sestak began playing piano, at the age of eight and a half, when he was sent by his parents to a piano teacher.[1] [2] In 2012 he told Birgitta Larsson of \"Jefferson Blues Magazine\":\"My father tried to teach me a little piano playing when I was 8, but I hated it. When I was nine and a half he sent me to a piano teacher. I didn’t like classical music at all. At eleven and a half, after two years of lessons, I was supposed to play a Beethoven sonata. It was after this point that playing the piano began to really give me pleasure. Today, however, my relating to classical music is diminishing again; to be honest, it isn’t easy to run on two tracks and my heart beats much louder for the blues.\"[3]After two years of classical piano lessons Sestak discovered jazz and blues music, in particular boogie-woogie, on the internet mainly through YouTube. Immediately captivated by this musical style, he began to teach himself blues piano while still taking classical lessons.[1] In December 2006, he shared his first videos on YouTube which brought him public fame. In 2007, at the age of 12, Sestak visited the famous International Boogie Woogie Festival at Lugano, Switzerland, where he knew Axel Zwingenberger would perform.[3]By March 2014 his earliest videos had received as many as 1.8 million hits.[4] After appearances in his home town of Karlsruhe, Sestak\\'s fame continued to grow through videos. As he grew older, he began performing regularly in concerts and festivals in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, France, Sweden, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, USA and other countries, alongside Vince Weber, Ben Waters, Silvan Zingg, Pete York, Bob Seeley and Frank Muschalle.[1]In 2010 Sestak appeared on German TV for the first time in “Kaffee oder Tee” on SWR.', 'MarciaBall': 'Marcia Ball (born March 20, 1949, Orange, Texas)[1] is an American blues singer and pianist raised in Vinton, Louisiana.[1]She was described in USA Today as \"a sensation, saucy singer and superb pianist... where Texas stomp-rock and Louisiana blues-swamp meet.\"[2] The Boston Globe described her music as \"an irresistible celebratory blend of rollicking, two-fisted New Orleans piano, Louisiana swamp rock and smoldering Texas blues from a contemporary storyteller.\"[3]Ball was born into a musical family. Her grandmother and aunt both played piano music of their time and Ball started piano lessons when she started school,[4] and showed an early interest in New Orleans style piano playing, as exemplified by Fats Domino, Professor Longhair, and James Booker. She has named Irma Thomas, the New Orleans vocalist, as her chief vocal inspiration. Ball studied English at Louisiana State University in the 1960s while playing in a band called Gum.[1] In 1970, at age 21, she started a progressive country band called Freda and the Firedogs in Austin, Texas, and began her solo career in 1974.[5]Ball\\'s piano style includes elements of zydeco, swamp blues, Louisiana blues and boogie woogie.[6] She began her recording career as a solo artist with Rounder Records in the 1980s and early 1990s.[5] In 2001, she joined the Chicago-based Alligator Records. Her Rounder album, Sing It!, which featured vocalists Irma Thomas and Tracy Nelson, released in January 1998 was nominated for a Grammy Award and a Blues Music Award for \"Best Contemporary Blues Album.\" Ball received the 1998 Blues Music Award for \"Contemporary Female Vocalist of the Year\" and \"Best Blues Instrumentalist-Keyboards.\"[7]She was awarded \"Contemporary Blues Album of the Year\" for her albums Presumed Innocent (2002) and So Many Rivers (2004). The same year she also won \"Contemporary Blues Artist of the Year-Female.\" She won the \"Best Blues Instrumentalist-Keyboards\" again in 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2009. The BMA for Keyboards has since been renamed the Pinetop Perkins Piano Player Award and Marcia has won that in 2012 and 2015. Her 2003 Alligator release, So Many Rivers, was nominated for a Grammy as were Live! Down The Road (2005) and Peace, Love & BBQ (2008). She was inducted into the Austin Music Hall of Fame in 1990.[citation needed]Ball has continued to work with Irma Thomas. In 2006, the two contributed a duet (\"Look Up\") on the New Orleans Social Club release, Sing Me Back Home (Burgundy Records/Honey Darling Records). In 2007, the two contributed another duet (\"I Can\\'t Get New Orleans Off My Mind\") to Goin\\' Home: A Tribute to Fats Domino (Vanguard Records). She continues to play at nightclubs, particularly in Austin and New Orleans, and performs at music festivals in North America and overseas.[1]In May 2015, Ball won the \\'Pinetop Perkins Piano Player\\' award at the Blues Music Awards ceremony.[8]', 'MauriceRocco': 'Maurice Rocco, born Maurice John Rockhold (June 26, 1915 – March 24, 1976)[1] was an African-American pianist, singer, actor, and composer known for playing boogie-woogie piano and his disdain for using a piano bench. He was a top nightclub and theater draw in the 1940s, and made several film appearances. He toured the United States, Canada, and Europe before becoming a fixture in Bangkok, Thailand, where he was murdered.Maurice Rockhold was born in 1915[2] in Oxford, Ohio to a music teacher mother.[3] His mother taught him classical piano starting at age 10,[4] but did not interfere with his interest in rhythm playing as long as he finished his lessons.[3] He entered Miami University as a music student (from where he was later to earn a Master of Music degree,)[5] but soon quit to work for radio station WLW.[3] In addition, he also taught piano harmony at Oberlin College.[4] His work at WLW impressed Noble Sissle so much that he hired him to work with the Rogers Sisters at the Kit Kat Club in New York, and the act was renamed The Three Roccos.[3] He was to later legally change his last name from Rockhold to Rocco.[3] In 1938, Rocco left the club to participate in two films, Vogues of 1938 and 52nd Street.[3] He returned to New York to form his own band,[3] which included Alton Moore, Arville Harris, and Bobby Holmes among its members.[6] By the early 1940s he was no longer fronting a band, but was working as a solo act.[7]Between 1940 and 1941 he cut 14 sides for Decca,[3] most of which were released on their \"Sepia\" series.[8] He did not join active military service because his poor eyesight classified him as 4-F,[4] but during World War II he entertained American troops, both in person[9] and as part of the American Forces Network Jubilee radio program.[10] Rocco spent most of the 1940s headlining at nightclubs and theaters (where his engagements would extend into months) and participating in vaudeville revues.[11][12][13][14] By 1944 he had a US $500,000 insurance policy on his hands.[4] Alongside Mary Lou Williams, he represented the United States in the second African Dance Festival at Carnegie Hall in April 1945.[15] He was married to Iantha on July 3 of that year.[16] Later in 1945, he appeared in his most famous role in the film Incendiary Blond. His earnings in 1945 topped U.S. $250,000.[17] Despite all the professional success, this marriage was short lived. Iantha filed for divorce before their first anniversary amid allegations of physical and mental abuse.[16] He signed to RCA Victor Records in 1949.[18]In the early 1950s he made tours of Europe and Southeast Asia.[19] Alongside Slim Gaillard, he was in 1953 solicited to play a lead role in a film to be entitled \"Two Joes from Georgia\".[20] Rocco fell into legal difficulties in the late 1950s regarding bad checks: he was jailed over Christmas 1957 in Cleveland,[21] and was accused of the same offense in July 1958.[22] He moved to Europe before spending the last 15 years of his life performing in Thailand,[23] where he was a regular tourist attraction at the Bamboo Bar in the Oriental Hotel in Bangkok.[24][25] He was found slashed to death in his apartment, death having occurred on March 24, 1976. The murder weapon was his own Malaysian knife.[23] At the time of his death he was married to Mary Arlene Rocco (1914–1994).[26] He is buried at Woodside Cemetery in Oxford.[2]Rocco was billed as \"Maurice Rocco and His Rockin\\' Rhythm\" in nightclubs and his recordings.[11] Maurice was most famous for standing while playing, not using a piano bench.[9] The origin of his playing posture has been credited to different sources. In 1944 Rocco claimed that he started standing in 1941, when a customer was sitting on his piano bench and Rocco, intimidated by the heft of this customer, decided that it would be best to play without the customary seat. He eschewed a piano bench from this point on because of the positive reaction from the crowd that night.[4] While playing, he would alternately beat out the rhythm with his feet, or perform dance moves.[27] Billboard described his playing as \"Rocking and Riotous\" but panned his singing ability.[28] His nightclub performances were known to be uncommonly boistrous for the period,[14] even moving the piano from one end of the stage to the other with \"violent energy,\"[29] but Duke Ellington and Mabel Mercer praised his ability to perform in a sophisticated manner.[23] His showmanship was as recognized as his piano playing,[30][31] and he was known to favor wearing a pea-green dinner jacket.[32] His performance style is said to have influenced Little Richard and Jerry Lee Lewis.[1] Critic Peter Silvester describes Rocco\\'s boogie-woogie style as \"technically slick\" but \"devoid of genuine boogie-woogie tone coloring.\"[33]Rocco was a headlining act for much of the 1940s, both in the United States and England.[18] His stand-up piano playing became a byline.[34] Because of his appearances in Hollywood musicals and \"soundies\" (musical short films) that were exported to Britain during the Second World War, Rocco\\'s playing style was to influence several European post-war boogie-woogie specialists.[33] He was an early influence on Ramsey Lewis[35] and Bobby Short.[36]Rocco made his first recordings, for Decca, recording 12 sides in 1940 and \\'41. Some of his most popular recordings first appeared on the Guild label, where he recorded 8 sides, with Cozy Cole on drums and Mack Stewart on bass. When this label went out of business, its catalog was sold to Musicraft Records[37][38] in 1946,[39] which re-issued all 8 of them. He cut 10 new sides for Musicraft in September, 1946, 7 of which were re-issued by Allegro on a vinyl 10 inch LP in 1957. A Musicraft album of 78\\'s numbered 449-452 was issued in 1946.[40]*There are two versions of each of these sides. St. Louis Blues, matrix A.G.634-A recorded by Guild and issued as Guild 102. Re-issued as Musicraft 353 B, some with matrix A.G.634-A and some simply with 634-A. Re-recorded by Musicraft, matrix 5391-B, and issued also as Musicraft 353 B.[43][44][54] Begin The Beguine, matrix A.G.633-A recorded by Guild and issued as Guild 102. Re-issued as Musicraft 353 A, some with matrix A.G.633-A and some with just 633-A. Re-recorded by Musicraft, matrix 5390-B, and also issued as 353 A. [55]For both songs, the Musicraft paper labels all say 5390 and 5391, only the matrix numbers on the shellac distinguish the takes.[43][44]|Rocco appeared in numerous Hollywood musicals in the 1940s and 1950s.[23]Rocco appeared regularly on network radio programs. Besides the usual guest spots, he was featured regularly on Duffy\\'s Tavern and The Radio Hall of Fame.[65]', 'MeadeLuxLewis': 'Anderson Meade Lewis (September 4, 1905 – June 7, 1964),[1] known as Meade Lux Lewis, was an American pianist and composer, noted for his playing in the boogie-woogie style. His best-known work, \"Honky Tonk Train Blues\", has been recorded by many artists.Lewis was born in Chicago,[1][2] though some sources state Louisville, Kentucky,[3] on September 4, 1905 (September 3 and 13 have also been cited as his date of birth in various sources). In his youth he was influenced by the pianist Jimmy Yancey.[4] His father, a guitarist who made two recordings of his own, introduced Meade to music and arranged for him to have violin lessons. He gave up the violin at age 16, shortly after his father\\'s death, and switched to the piano. The nickname \"Lux\" was given to him by his boyhood friends. He would imitate a couple of characters from a popular comic strip in Chicago, Alphonse and Gaston, and stroke an imaginary beard as part of the routine. His friends started calling him the Duke of Luxembourg because of this, and the name stuck for the rest of his life. He became friends with Albert Ammons during childhood, a friendship that would last throughout their lives. They went to the same school together briefly, and they practiced and learned the piano together on the Ammons family piano.[5]:90–91A 1927 rendition of \"Honky Tonk Train Blues\", released by Paramount Records, marked his recording debut.[4] He remade it for Parlophone in 1935 and for Victor in 1937, and a recording exists of a radio show, Camel Caravan, broadcast from New York City in 1939, which includes \"Honky Tonk Train Blues\". His performance at John Hammond\\'s historic From Spirituals to Swing concert at Carnegie Hall in 1938 brought Lewis to public attention.[2] Following the event, Lewis and two other performers from that concert, Albert Ammons and Pete Johnson, often appeared as a trio and became the leading boogie-woogie pianists of the day.[4][2]They had an extended engagement at Café Society, toured as a trio, and inspired the formation of Blue Note Records in 1939. Their success led to a decade-long boogie-woogie craze,[6] with big-band swing treatments by Tommy Dorsey, Will Bradley, and others; and numerous country boogie and early rock-and-roll songs.Lewis appeared in the movies New Orleans (1947) and Nightmare (1956).[4] He also appeared, uncredited, in the movie It\\'s a Wonderful Life, playing piano in the scene where George Bailey gets thrown out of Nick\\'s Bar.[7]Lewis was fond of the Minneapolis area, where a niece lived, and would visit as often as he could. He appeared annually at the White House Restaurant (no longer extant) in Golden Valley. He began a successful three-week engagement there in May 1964. Around two a.m. on Sunday, June 7, Lewis left the parking lot of the White House and headed east on Olson Memorial Highway, his Chrysler Imperial was rear-ended by a vehicle driven by one Ronald Bates, who was traveling an estimated 80\\xa0mph. Lewis\\'s car was pushed 400 feet and crashed into a tree; he was killed instantly. He was 58. Bates survived, but his passenger died the following day.[5]:225Lewis\\' best-known work, \"Honky Tonk Train Blues\", has been recorded in various contexts, often in a big band arrangement.[4] Early recordings of the piece by artists other than Lewis include performances by Adrian Rollini, Frankie Trumbauer, classical harpsichordist Sylvia Marlowe, theater organist George Wright (with drummer Cozy Cole, under the title \"Organ Boogie\"), and Bob Zurke with Bob Crosby\\'s orchestra. Keith Emerson of Emerson, Lake & Palmer often included it in his repertoire and had a Top 30 hit with it in 1976.Lewis was mentioned in Chapter 81 of author Kurt Vonnegut\\'s novel Cat\\'s Cradle. Lewis is also mentioned in Ross Macdonald\\'s novel The Moving Target and in Keith Richards\\'s autobiography Life.', 'MemphisSlim': 'Memphis Slim (September 3, 1915 – February 24, 1988) was an American blues pianist, singer, and composer. He led a series of bands that, reflecting the popular appeal of jump blues, included saxophones, bass, drums, and piano. A song he first cut in 1947, \"Every Day I Have the Blues\", has become a blues standard, recorded by many other artists. He made over 500 recordings.Memphis Slim was born John Len Chatman, in Memphis, Tennessee. For his first recordings, for Okeh Records in 1940, he used the name of his father, Peter Chatman (who sang, played piano and guitar, and operated juke joints);[1] it is commonly believed that he did so to honor his father. He started performing under the name \"Memphis Slim\" later that year but continued to publish songs under the name Peter Chatman.He spent most of the 1930s performing in honky-tonks, dance halls, and gambling joints in West Memphis, Arkansas, and southeast Missouri. He settled in Chicago in 1939 and began teaming with the guitarist and singer Big Bill Broonzy in clubs soon afterward. In 1940 and 1941 he recorded two songs for Bluebird Records that became part of his repertoire for decades, \"Beer Drinking Woman\"[2] and \"Grinder Man Blues\". These were released under the name \"Memphis Slim,\" given to him by Bluebird\\'s producer, Lester Melrose.[3] Slim became a regular session musician for Bluebird, and his piano talents supported established stars such as John Lee \"Sonny Boy\" Williamson, Washboard Sam, and Jazz Gillum. Many of Slim\\'s recordings and performances until the mid-1940s were with Broonzy, who had recruited Slim to be his piano player after the death of his accompanist Joshua Altheimer in 1940.After World War II, Slim began leading bands that generally included saxophones, bass, drums, and piano, reflecting the popular appeal of jump blues. With the decline of blues recording by the major labels, Slim worked with emerging independent labels. Starting in late 1945, he recorded with trios for the small Chicago-based Hy-Tone Records.[4] With a lineup of alto saxophone, tenor sax, piano, and string bass (Willie Dixon played the instrument on the first session), he signed with the Miracle label in the fall of 1946. One of the songs recorded at the first session was the ebullient boogie \"Rockin\\' the House,\" from which his band would take its name. Slim and the House Rockers recorded mainly for Miracle through 1949, with some commercial success. Among the songs they recorded were \"Messin\\' Around\" (which reached number one on the R&B charts in 1948) and \"Harlem Bound\".[5] In 1947, the day after producing a concert by Slim, Broonzy, and Williamson at New York City\\'s Town Hall, the folklorist Alan Lomax brought the three musicians to the Decca Records studios and recorded with Slim on vocal and piano. Lomax presented sections of this recording on BBC Radio in the early 1950s as a documentary, The Art of the Negro, and later released an expanded version as the LP Blues in the Mississippi Night. In 1949, Slim expanded his combo to a quintet by adding a drummer; the group was now spending most of its time on tour, leading to off-contract recording sessions for King Records in Cincinnati and Peacock Records in Houston.One of Slim\\'s 1947 recordings for Miracle, released in 1949, was originally titled \"Nobody Loves Me\". It has become as famous as \"Every Day I Have the Blues.\" The song was recorded in 1950 by Lowell Fulson and subsequently by numerous other artists, including B. B. King, Elmore James, T-Bone Walker, Ray Charles, Eric Clapton, Natalie Cole, Ella Fitzgerald, Jimi Hendrix, Mahalia Jackson, Sarah Vaughan, Carlos Santana, John Mayer and Lou Rawls.[6] Joe Williams recorded it in 1952 for Checker Records; his remake from 1956 (included on the album Count Basie Swings, Joe Williams Sings) was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1992.[7]Early in 1950, Miracle succumbed to financial troubles, but its owners regrouped to form the Premium label, and Slim remained on board until the successor company faltered in the summer of 1951. His February 1951 session for Premium saw two changes in the House Rockers\\' lineup: Slim started using two tenor saxophones instead of the alto and tenor combination, and he made a trial of adding the guitarist Ike Perkins. His last session for Premium kept the two-tenor lineup but dispensed with the guitar. During his time with Premium, Slim first recorded his song \"Mother Earth\".[8]Slim made just one session for King, but the company bought his Hy-Tone sides in 1948 and acquired his Miracle masters after that company failed in 1950. He was never a Chess artist, but Leonard Chess bought most of the Premium masters after the demise of Premium.After a year with Mercury Records, Slim signed with United Records in Chicago;[9] the A&R man, Lew Simpkins, knew him from Miracle and Premium. The timing was propitious, because he had just added the guitarist Matt \"Guitar\" Murphy to his group. He remained with United through the end of 1954, when the company began to cut back on blues recording.[10]After 1954, Slim did not have a steady relationship with a record company until 1958, when he signed with Vee-Jay Records. In 1959 his band, still featuring Murphy, recorded the album Memphis Slim at the Gate of the Horn, which featured a lineup of his best-known songs, including \"Mother Earth\", \"Gotta Find My Baby\", \"Rockin\\' the Blues\", \"Steppin\\' Out\", and \"Slim\\'s Blues\".[11]Slim first appeared outside the United States in 1960, touring with Willie Dixon, with whom he returned to Europe in 1962 as a featured artist in the first of the series of American Folk Festival concerts organized by Dixon, which brought many notable blues artists to Europe in the 1960s and 1970s. The duo released several albums together on Folkways Records, including Memphis Slim and Willie Dixon at the Village Gate with Pete Seeger (1962)[12]In 1962 Slim moved permanently to Paris, and his engaging personality and well-honed presentation of playing, singing, and storytelling about the blues secured his position as one of the most prominent blues artists for nearly three decades. He appeared on television in numerous European countries, acted in several French films and wrote the score for À nous deux France (1970), and performed regularly in Paris, throughout Europe, and on return visits to the United States. In the last years of his life, he teamed up with the respected jazz drummer George Collier. The two toured Europe together and became friends. After Collier died in August 1987, Slim rarely appeared in public, although he reunited with Matt \"Guitar\" Murphy for a gig at Antone\\'s in Austin, Texas, in 1987.Two years before his death, Slim was named a Commander in the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of France. In addition, the U.S. Senate honored Slim with the title of Ambassador-at-Large of Good Will.[13]Memphis Slim died of renal failure on February 24, 1988, in Paris, at the age of 72. He is buried at Galilee Memorial Gardens in Memphis, Tennessee.[14]He was posthumously inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1989. He was inducted into the Memphis Music Hall of Fame in 2015.[15][16]', 'MichaelKaeshammer': 'True North Records\\neOne\\nAlert/Universal RecordsMichael Kaeshammer is a Canadian jazz & boogie-woogie pianist, vocalist, songwriter, arranger and producer.After studying classical piano for seven years in his German hometown Offenburg, 13-year-old Kaeshammer discovered boogie-woogie and stride piano as played by Albert Ammons, Meade Lux Lewis, and Pete Johnson. Within three years he was playing jazz & boogie-woogie in clubs, concerts and festivals all over Germany and other surrounding parts of Europe. He attracted attention almost immediately after the family moved to the west coast of Canada, performing at festivals across the country during the summer of 1996.Since then Michael has released Blue Keys (1996), Tell You How I Feel (1998), No Strings Attached (2000), Strut (2003) Days Like These (2007), Lovelight (2009), Kaeshammer (2011), KaeshammerLIVE! (2012), With You In Mind (2013), The Pianist (2015) and No Filter (2016). Kaeshammer has been nominated for 7 Juno Awards. He has also received the West Coast Music Award for “Musician Of The Year” and “Entertainer Of The Year”.', 'MitchWoods': 'Mitch Woods (born April 3, 1951, Brooklyn, New York, United States[2]) is an American modern day boogie-woogie,[1] jump blues and jazz pianist and singer.[1] Since the early 1980s he has been touring and recording with his band, the Rocket 88s.[3] Woods calls his music, \"rock-a-boogie,\" and with his backing band has retrospectively provided a 1940s and 1950s jump blues style.[2]Woods got his start playing clubs near the State University of New York Buffalo campus. He moved to San Francisco in 1971.[4]Originally a student of jazz and classical music, on relocation to the West Coast, Woods started playing jump and rhythm and blues. Upon hearing Louis Jordan\\'s jive, Woods played throughout the 1970s as a soloist at local clubs. In 1984, Blind Pig released the debut album of the Rocket 88s, the band he had formed with HiTide Harris four years earlier. Steady Date with Mitch Woods & His Rocket 88s led to a national concert tour, including the San Francisco Blues Festival in 1985, as well as several European engagements. In 1988, they issued their second LP, Mr. Boogie\\'s Back in Town.[2]In 1991 their third album, Solid Gold Cadillac, was released, followed by Shakin\\' the Shack (1993).[2] Woods, capable in four styles of piano playing, Chicago blues, Kansas City boogie-woogie, West Coast jump blues and the poly-rhythmic accents of New Orleans, got the opportunity to play with some of his musical heroes, when he recorded his 1996 Viceroy album, Keeper of the Flame.[5] Their next album, Jump for Joy, appeared in 2001.[2]The 2006 release, Big Easy Boogie featured veteran New Orleans musicians backing Woods.[6] In 2007 Woods was nominated for the Pinetop Perkins Piano Player of the Year Award at the Blues Awards in Memphis, Tennessee, presented by the Blues Foundation.[7]Latterly he and his band toured with the Efes Pilsen Blues Festival.[8]', 'MontanaTaylor': 'Arthur \"Montana\" Taylor (1903 – c.1958)[1] was an American boogie-woogie and piano blues pianist, best known for his recordings in the 1940s, and regarded as the leading exponent of the \"barrelhouse\" style of playing.[2]Taylor was born in Butte, Montana, where his father owned a club. The family moved to Chicago and then, around 1910, to Indianapolis, where Taylor learned piano. Later he moved to Cleveland, Ohio. By 1929 he was back in Chicago, where he recorded a few tracks for Vocalion Records, including \"Indiana Avenue Stomp\" and \"Detroit Rocks\".[2]He then disappeared from the public record for some years, during which he may have given up playing piano. However, in 1946 he was rediscovered by jazz fan Rudi Blesh, and was recorded both solo and as the accompanist to Bertha \"Chippie\" Hill. The later recordings proved he had lost none of his instrumental abilities, and had developed as a singer.[2]Taylor\\'s final recordings were from a 1946 radio broadcast and after that he was reported working as a chauffeur.[3]Montana Taylor died soon after 1957, when he was last recorded as living in Cleveland.[4]In 1977, Taylor\\'s complete recordings were compiled by Martin van Olderen for the Oldie Blues label. Included were two then recently discovered radio performances from 1946.[3] In 2002 Document Records released the complete recordings on CD.', 'MoonMullican': 'Aubrey Wilson Mullican (March 29, 1909 – January 1, 1967), known as Moon Mullican and \"King of the Hillbilly Piano Players\", was an American country and western singer, songwriter, and pianist. He was associated with the hillbilly boogie style which greatly influenced rockabilly. Jerry Lee Lewis cited him as a major influence on his own singing and piano playing.Mullican once stated, \"We gotta play music that\\'ll make them goddamn beer bottles bounce on the table\".[1]Mullican was born to Oscar Luther Mullican (1876–1961) and his first wife, Virginia Jordan Mullican (1880–1915), near Corrigan, Polk County, Texas. They were a farming family of Scottish, Irish and Eastern European ancestry. His Scots-Irish immigrant ancestor, James Mullikin, was born in Scotland, arriving in Maryland in the 1630s from Northern Ireland. His paternal grandfather was Pvt. Wilson G. Mullican, who served in the 6th Mississippi Infantry, Confederate States Army, at the Battle of Shiloh. Mullican\\'s parents, stepmother, and grandparents are all buried in Stryker Cemetery, Polk County, Texas.As a child, Mullican began playing the organ, which his religious father had purchased in order to better sing hymns at church. However, Moon made friends with Joe Jones, a black sharecropper on the family farm, who introduced him to the country blues. Moon\\'s parents did not always approve, and he was torn between religious and secular music. After making his mark as a local piano player, Mullican left home at age 16, going to Houston, where he played piano and sang in local clubs. His early career choice had been either to be a singer or a preacher, and he decided on music.By the 1930s, Mullican had acquired his nickname \"Moon\". Published sources suggest it is short for \"moonshine\" or possibly from his all-night performances; his family says it was because he loved to play \"Shoot the Moon\", a variation of the dominoes game \"42\".His earliest influences were popular blues artists of the day such as Bessie Smith, Blind Lemon Jefferson and Leroy Carr, together with country musicians including Jimmie Rodgers and Bob Wills.[2] In 1936, he covered Cab Calloway\\'s \"Georgia Pine\" and also sang his own compositions \"Ain\\'t You Kinda Sorry\" and \"Swing Baby Swing\" for Leon Selph\\'s Western swing band, The Blue Ridge Playboys. He also played and recorded with Cliff Bruner\\'s Texas Wanderers, the Sunshine Boys, and Jimmie Davis. By the end of the 1930s, he had also become a popular vocalist with a warm, deep, vocal delivery.In the early 1940s, he returned to the Texas Wanderers as lead singer and pianist, sang on the hits \"Truck Driver\\'s Blues\" and \"I\\'ll Keep On Loving You\". However, after leaving the Texas Wanderers in 1942, he became a session musician playing on the songs of Floyd Tillman, Ernest Tubb, and Red Foley.In 1945 he put together his own band, the Showboys, who quickly became one of the most popular outfits in the Texas-Louisiana area with a mix of country music, Western swing, Cajun music, and Mullican\\'s wild piano playing and singing. Although their style was highly eclectic and included country ballads, some of their music clearly foreshadowed what would later be called rock and roll. In September 1946, Mullican cut 16 recordings as band leader, for King Records in Cincinnati. His first release, \"The Lonesome Hearted Blues\" b/w \"It\\'s a Sin to Love You Like I Do\" sold quite well, but did not chart. His second release, \"New Jole Blon\" in December 1946 (later recorded by Doug Kershaw), gained him even larger recognition by reaching number 2 on the Country and Western charts. \"Jole Blon\" was the beginning of a long string of big hits. He became a member of the Grand Ole Opry in 1951.[3][4]Mullican was one of the highest-selling artists coming from King Records. Though not a major chart success, he was immensely popular in the southeastern United States with such gold records such as \"The Leaves Mustn\\'t Fall\", \"Hey Shah\", \"You Don\\'t Have to Be a Baby to Cry\", \"Nine Tenths of the Tennessee River\", and \"I Was Sorta Wonderin\\'\".In the mid-1950s, many artists, such as Lefty Frizzell and George Jones experimented with rock \\'n\\' roll largely due to the decline of traditional country-and-western in the mid-1950s. Mullican\\'s success also declined during this time, and so he recorded four rock sides with Boyd Bennett and His Rockets, including the classic \"Seven Nights to Rock\". However, both singles failed miserably. Before he signed to Coral in 1958, he had three other hits with King, including \"Hey Shah\".In 1958 he was signed by Owen Bradley to Coral Records, and recorded more rock songs including \"Moon\\'s Rock\" and \"Sweet Rockin\\' Music\". Devastated by the failure of his rock sides, Owen Bradley convinced Mullican to record his original songs in the burgeoning new style of country music, the Nashville sound. However, Bradley was frustrated with Mullican; he reportedly said himself, \"There was nothing I could do with him.\" Mullican, whose style was largely in traditional honky tonk, found it difficult to make such a large adjustment to his style. Consequently, he was dropped from Coral in 1959.In the early 1960s, Mullican was a largely forgotten figure nationally, but based himself in Texas and carried on gigging and recording for the Starday and Spar labels. The decade saw him record country songs like \"I\\'ll Pour the Wine\" and \"Love Don\\'t Have a Guarantee\", together with less notable oddities including \"I Ain\\'t No Beatle, But I Wanna Hold Your Hand\". One of his last records, \"Love That Might Have Been\", was excellent and should have been the start of a whole new stage in the singer’s career.[according to whom?] However, Mullican had a heart condition, although he continued to perform regularly. On New Year\\'s Eve 1966, he suffered a heart attack in Beaumont, Texas, and died early in the morning on January 1, 1967. He and his wife, Eunice, who survived him (she died in 1973), had no children.During the late 1940s and early 1950s, Mullican influenced many other country artists. He had defined a style of country balladeering not hinted at in his 1930s work. This style of music influenced Jim Reeves (a band member for a while), Hank Williams (who named Mullican as a favorite artist), Hank Snow, Bill Haley, Elvis Presley, and especially Jerry Lee Lewis, who covered many of Mullican\\'s songs. It was in the realm of hillbilly boogie, however, that Mullican had his greatest influence.[citation needed] Many of his songs, such as \"Pipeliners Blues\", \"Hey! Mister Cotton-Picker\" and \"Cherokee Boogie\" (his biggest hit, in 1951) directly foreshadowed the style adopted by Haley and later rock\\'n\\'rollers. Mullican also influenced many others, some of whom recorded tribute CDs to mark Mullican\\'s 100th birthday in 2009, and the Western swing band Asleep at the Wheel, who recorded his song \"Cherokee Boogie\" on their 1973 album Comin\\' Right At Ya.Mullican is also believed to have co-written \"Jambalaya\", made famous by Hank Williams, but which could not be credited to him because of his contract with King Records.[5]Moon\\'s epitaph is the name of one of his many hits, \"I\\'ll Sail My Ship Alone\".In 1976 he was posthumously inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame. There have been many posthumous compilations of his music, on various labels including Ace and Bear Family.[5]', 'NevilleDickie': 'Neville Dickie (born 1 January 1937 in Durham[1]) is an English boogie-woogie and stride piano player.[1] He has performed all over Europe and North America.After serving in the RAF, Dickie left Durham and moved to London, where he began playing piano for small wages in various pubs. It was only after Doreen Davies, who was head of BBC Radio 2, noticed him at a BBC audition that he took a notable stride in his musical career.[1] He has played on hundreds of BBC Radio broadcasts.Dickie has produced scores of records and can be heard on hundreds of jazz recordings, as well as several recordings with the French pianist, Louis Mazetier. Dickie had a Top 40 UK hit single in 1969 with \"Robin\\'s Return\" on the Major Minor Records label (MM 644). It reached number 33 on the UK Singles Chart.[2]His album Back to Boogie (1975) has sold over 100,000 copies.[1] Dickie formed a band called the Rhythmakers in 1985 and continues to perform with that group and with his trio.[1] He appears regularly at festivals in the United States.', 'OmarShariff': 'Dave Alexander (born David Alexander Elam), also known as Omar Sharriff, Omar Shariff, Omar Hakim Khayam (March 10, 1938 – January 8, 2012) was an American Texas blues singer and pianist.[1]Alexander was born in Shreveport, Louisiana, in 1938, and grew up in Marshall, Texas. His father was a pianist, and his mother encouraged him to play in church. Alexander joined the United States Navy in 1955. He moved to Oakland, California, in 1957, and began a long history of working with various San Francisco Bay area musicians. A self-taught pianist, he played with Big Mama Thornton, Jimmy Witherspoon, Muddy Waters, Buddy Guy and Albert Collins. In 1968, he recorded his first songs for the compilation album Oakland Blues, released by World Pacific Records. He performed at the Ann Arbor Blues and Jazz Festival in 1970 and at the San Francisco Blues Festival many times from 1973 onward. He was the warm-up act at the Last Waltz, a concert staged by the Band at the Winterland Ballroom, on Thanksgiving Day, November 25, 1976. He also performed in Europe.Alexander recorded two albums, The Rattler (1972) and The Dirt on the Ground (1973), for Arhoolie Records,[2] containing the songs \"The Hoodoo Man (The Voodoo Woman and the Witch Doctor)\", \"St. James Infirmary\", \"Blue Tumbleweed\", \"Sundown\", \"Sufferin\\' with the Lowdown Blues\", \"Strange Woman\", \"Cold Feelin\", \"Jimmy, Is That You?\", \"So You Wanna Be a Man\" and \"The Dirt on the Ground\".[3]In 1976, he began to perform as Omar the Magnificent, having changed his name to Omar Khayam.[4]He was nominated for a W. C. Handy Award in 1993.[5]Have Mercy! Records, a small blues label, released his album Black Widow Spider in 1993, followed by the hit Baddass in 1995 and Anatomy of a Woman in 1998.In the 2000s Alexander lived and performed mostly in the Sacramento area, where he recorded for Have Mercy! Records. He was an articulate writer, contributing several articles to Living Blues magazine. and an advocate for the blues and African-American music.[6][7]On Martin Luther King Day in 2011, the NPR Radio program All Things Considered broadcast a segment about Marshall, Texas, as the birthplace of the boogie-woogie style of piano playing. The broadcast described how Dr. John Tennison, a boogie-woogie musicologist in San Antonio, had shared his knowledge of the history of boogie-woogie with the citizens of Marshall and had located Alexander in Sacramento. Alexander had performed in Marshall in December 2010, to great acclaim.[8] He relocated to Marshall in February 2011 and lived there until his death.On January 8, 2012, Alexander was found dead of an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound at his home in Marshall, Texas. He was 73 years old.[9][10]', 'OscarPeterson': 'Oscar Emmanuel Peterson, CC, CQ, OOnt (August 15, 1925\\xa0– December 23, 2007) was a Canadian jazz pianist and composer. He was called the \"Maharaja of the keyboard\" by Duke Ellington, but simply \"O.P.\" by his friends.[1][2] He released over 200 recordings, won eight Grammy Awards, and received numerous other awards and honours. He is considered one of the greatest jazz pianists,[3] and played thousands of concerts worldwide in a career lasting more than 60 years.Peterson was born to immigrants from the West Indies; his father worked as a porter for Canadian Pacific Railway.[4] Peterson grew up in the neighbourhood of Little Burgundy in Montreal, Quebec. It was in this predominantly black neighbourhood that he found himself surrounded by the jazz culture that flourished in the early 20th century.[5] At the age of five, Peterson began honing his skills with the trumpet and piano. However, a bout of tuberculosis when he was seven prevented him from playing the trumpet again, and so he directed all his attention to the piano. His father, Daniel Peterson, an amateur trumpeter and pianist, was one of his first music teachers, and his sister Daisy taught young Oscar classical piano. Young Oscar was persistent at practicing scales and classical études daily, and thanks to such arduous practice he developed his virtuosity.As a child, Peterson also studied with Hungarian-born pianist Paul de Marky, a student of István Thomán, who was himself a pupil of Franz Liszt, so his training was predominantly based on classical piano. Meanwhile, he was captivated by traditional jazz and learned several ragtime pieces and especially the boogie-woogie. At that time Peterson was called \"the Brown Bomber of the Boogie-Woogie\".[6]At the age of nine Peterson played piano with control that impressed professional musicians. For many years his piano studies included four to six hours of practice daily. Only in his later years did he decrease his daily practice to just one or two hours. In 1940, at fourteen years of age, Peterson won the national music competition organized by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. After that victory, he dropped out of school and became a professional pianist working for a weekly radio show, and playing at hotels and music halls.Some of the artists who influenced Peterson\\'s music during the earlier type of years were Teddy Wilson, Nat \"King\" Cole, James P. Johnson and Art Tatum, to whom many tried to compare Peterson in later years.[7] One of his first exposures to Tatum\\'s musical talents came early in his teen years when his father played a recording of Tatum\\'s \"Tiger Rag\" for him, and Peterson was so intimidated by what he heard that he became disillusioned about his own playing, to the extent of refusing to play the piano at all for several weeks. In his own words, \"Tatum scared me to death\", and Peterson was \"never cocky again\" about his mastery at the piano.[8] Tatum was a model for Peterson\\'s musicianship during the 1940s and 1950s. Tatum and Peterson eventually became good friends, although Peterson was always shy about being compared with Tatum and rarely played the piano in Tatum\\'s presence.Peterson also credited his sister—a piano teacher in Montreal who also taught several other Canadian jazz musicians—with being an important teacher and influence on his career. Under his sister\\'s tutelage, Peterson expanded into classical piano training and broadened his range while mastering the core classical pianism from scales to preludes and fugues by Johann Sebastian Bach.[9]Building on Tatum\\'s pianism and aesthetics, Peterson also absorbed Tatum\\'s musical influences, notably from piano concertos by Sergei Rachmaninoff. Rachmaninoff\\'s harmonizations, as well as direct quotations from his 2nd Piano Concerto, are thrown in here and there in many recordings by Peterson, including his work with the most familiar formulation of the Oscar Peterson Trio, with bassist Ray Brown and guitarist Herb Ellis. During the 1960s and 1970s Peterson made numerous trio recordings highlighting his piano performances that reveal more of his eclectic style that absorbed influences from various genres of jazz, popular and classical music.An important step in Peterson\\'s career was joining impresario Norman Granz\\'s labels (especially Verve) and Granz\\'s \"Jazz at the Philharmonic\" project. Granz discovered Peterson in a peculiar manner. As the impresario was being taken to Montreal airport by cab, the radio was playing a live broadcast of Peterson at a local night club. Granz was so smitten by what he heard that he ordered the driver to take him to the club so that he could meet the pianist. In 1949, Granz introduced Peterson at a Carnegie Hall Jazz at the Philharmonic show in New York City.[6]So was born a lasting relationship and Granz remained Peterson\\'s manager for most of his career. This was more than a managerial relationship; Peterson praised Granz for standing up for him and other black jazz musicians in the segregationist south of the 1950s and 1960s. For example, in the documentary video Music in the Key of Oscar, Peterson tells how Granz stood up to a gun-toting southern policeman who wanted to stop the trio from using \"white-only\" taxis.[10]In the course of his career, Peterson developed a reputation as a technically brilliant and melodically inventive jazz pianist and became a regular on Canadian radio from the 1940s. His name was already recognized in the United States. However, his 1949 debut at Carnegie Hall was uncredited; owing to union restrictions, his appearance could not be billed.[11] Through Granz\\'s Jazz at the Philharmonic he was able to play with the major jazz artists of the time.Peterson made numerous duo performances and recordings with bassists Ray Brown, Sam Jones, and Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen, guitarists Joe Pass, Irving Ashby, Herb Ellis, and Barney Kessel, pianists Count Basie, Herbie Hancock, Benny Green, and Oliver Jones, trumpeters Clark Terry and Louis Armstrong, and many other important jazz players.[citation needed] His 1950s duo recordings with Ray Brown mark the formation of one of the longest lasting partnerships in the history of jazz.According to pianist/educator Mark Eisenman, some of Peterson\\'s best playing was as an understated accompanist to singer Ella Fitzgerald and trumpeter Roy Eldridge.[12]Peterson redefined the jazz trio by bringing the musicianship of all three members to the highest level. The trio with Ray Brown and Herb Ellis was, in his own words, \"the most stimulating\" and productive setting for public performances as well as in studio recordings. In the early 1950s, Peterson began performing with Ray Brown and Charlie Smith as the Oscar Peterson Trio. Shortly afterward the drummer Smith was replaced by guitarist Irving Ashby, formerly of the Nat King Cole Trio. Ashby, who was a swing guitarist, was soon replaced by Kessel.[13] Kessel tired of touring after a year, and was succeeded by Ellis. As Ellis was white, Peterson\\'s trios were racially integrated, a controversial move at the time that was fraught with difficulties with segregationist whites and blacks.Oscar Peterson at the Stratford Shakespearean Festival is widely regarded as the landmark album in Peterson\\'s career, and one of the most influential trios in jazz.[citation needed] Their last recording, On the Town with the Oscar Peterson Trio, recorded live at the Town Tavern in Toronto, captured a remarkable degree of emotional as well as musical understanding between three players.[14] All three musicians were equal contributors involved in a highly sophisticated improvisational interplay. When Ellis left the group in 1958, Peterson and Brown believed they could not adequately replace Ellis. Ellis was replaced by drummer Ed Thigpen in 1959. Brown and Thigpen worked with Peterson on his albums Night Train and Canadiana Suite. Brown and Thigpen left in 1965 and were replaced by bassist Sam Jones and drummer Louis Hayes (and later, drummer Bobby Durham). The trio performed together until 1970. In 1969 Peterson recorded Motions and Emotions, featuring orchestral arrangements of pop songs such as The Beatles\\' \"Yesterday\" and \"Eleanor Rigby\". In the fall of 1970, Peterson\\'s trio released the album Tristeza on Piano. Jones and Durham left in 1970.In the 1970s Peterson formed another trio with guitarist Pass and Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen on bass. This trio emulated the success of the 1950s trio with Brown and Ellis, gave acclaimed performances at numerous festivals, and made best-selling recordings, most notably The Trio, which won the 1974 Grammy for Best Jazz Performance by a Group, and the 1978 double album recorded live in Paris. In 1974 Oscar added British drummer Martin Drew, and this quartet toured and recorded extensively worldwide. Pass said in a 1976 interview: \"The only guys I\\'ve heard who come close to total mastery of their instruments are Art Tatum and Peterson\".A quartet was a less permanent setting for Peterson, after the trio or duo, as it was hard to find equally powerful musicians available for a tightly knit arrangement with him. After the loss of Ellis his next trio eventually consisted of a drummer instead of a guitarist—first Gene Gammage for a brief time, then Thigpen. In this group Peterson became the dominant soloist. Later members of the group were Louis Hayes, Bobby Durham, Ray Price, Sam Jones, George Mraz, Martin Drew, Terry Clarke and Lorne Lofsky.[3]Peterson often formed a quartet by adding a fourth player to his existing trios. He was open to experimental collaborations with jazz stars, such as saxophonist Ben Webster, trumpeter Clark Terry, and vibraphonist Milt Jackson among others. In 1961, the Peterson trio with Jackson recorded the album Very Tall.From the late 1950s, when Peterson gained worldwide recognition as one of the leading pianists in jazz, he played in a variety of settings: solo, duo, trio, quartet, small bands, and big bands. However, his solo piano recitals, as well as his solo piano recordings were rare, until he chose to make a series of solo albums titled Exclusively for My Friends. These solo piano sessions, made for the Musik Produktion Schwarzwald (MPS) label, were Peterson\\'s response to the emergence of such stars as Bill Evans and McCoy Tyner.Some cognoscenti assert that Peterson\\'s best recordings were made for MPS in the late 1960s and early 1970s. For some years subsequently he recorded for Granz\\'s Pablo Records after the label was founded in 1973.[15] In the 1990s and 2000s he recorded several albums accompanied by a combo for Telarc.In the 1980s he played successfully in a duo with pianist Herbie Hancock. In the late 1980s and 1990s, after a stroke, Peterson made performances and recordings with his protégé Benny Green.Peterson wrote pieces for piano, for trio, for quartet and for big band. He also wrote several songs, and made recordings as a singer. Probably his best-known compositions are \"Canadiana Suite\" and \"Hymn to Freedom\", the latter composed in the 1960s and inspired by the civil rights movement in the United States.Peterson taught piano and improvisation in Canada, mainly in Toronto. With associates, he started and headed the Advanced School of Contemporary Music in Toronto for five years during the 1960s, but it closed because concert touring called him and his associates away, and it did not have government funding.[16] Later, he mentored the York University jazz program and was the Chancellor of the entire university for several years in the early 1990s. He also published his original jazz piano etudes for practice. However, he asked his students to study the music of Johann Sebastian Bach, especially The Well-Tempered Clavier, the Goldberg Variations, and The Art of Fugue, considering these piano pieces essential for every serious pianist. Pianists Benny Green and Oliver Jones were among his students.[17]Peterson had arthritis since his youth, and in later years could hardly button his shirt. Never slender, his weight increased to 125\\xa0kg (276\\xa0lb), hindering his mobility. He had hip replacement surgery in the early 1990s.[18] Although the surgery was successful, his mobility was still inhibited. Somewhat later, in 1993, Peterson suffered a serious stroke that weakened his left side and sidelined him for two years. Also in 1993 incoming Prime Minister and longtime Peterson fan and friend Jean Chrétien offered Peterson the position of Lieutenant-Governor of Ontario, but according to Chrétien he declined, citing the health problems from his recent stroke.[19]After the stroke, Peterson recuperated for about two years. He gradually regained mobility and some control of his left hand. However, his virtuosity was never restored to the original level, and his playing after his stroke relied principally on his right hand.[20] In 1995 he returned to public performances on a limited basis, and also made several live and studio recordings for Telarc. In 1997 he received a Grammy for Lifetime Achievement and an International Jazz Hall of Fame Award. Canadian politician, friend, and amateur pianist Bob Rae contends that \"a one-handed Oscar was better than just about anyone with two hands\".[21]In 2003, Peterson recorded the DVD A Night in Vienna for Verve, with Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen (NHØP), Ulf Wakenius and Martin Drew. He continued to tour the U.S. and Europe, though maximally one month a year, with a couple of days\\' rest between concerts to recover his strength. His accompanists consisted of Ulf Wakenius (guitar), NHØP or David Young (bass),[22] and Alvin Queen (drums).Peterson\\'s health declined rapidly in 2007. He had to cancel his performance at the 2007 Toronto Jazz Festival and his attendance at a June 8, 2007, Carnegie Hall all-star performance in his honour, owing to illness. On December 23, 2007, Peterson died of kidney failure at his home in Mississauga, Ontario.[23][24]Peterson was married four times: Lillie Fraser (1944; two sons; three daughters; marriage dissolved); Sandra King (marriage 1958, dissolved 1976); Charlotte Huber (1977, one daughter; marriage dissolved); Kelly Green (1987(?), one daughter). [25][26]He had seven children, the youngest of whom was Céline (born 1991), his daughter by Kelly Green.Begone Dull Care is an abstract film presentation of Peterson\\'s music, directed by Norman McLaren and Evelyn Lambart, and released in 1949 by the National Film Board of Canada.[27]Peterson\\'s work earned him eight Grammy awards over the years and he was elected to the Canadian Music Hall of Fame in 1978. He also belongs to the Juno Awards Hall of Fame and the Canadian Jazz and Blues Hall of Fame. In 2013, Peterson was inducted into Canada\\'s Walk of Fame.Peterson received the first Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Achievement Award from Black Theatre Workshop (1986), Roy Thomson Award (1987), a Toronto Arts Award for lifetime achievement (1991), the Governor General\\'s Performing Arts Award (1992), the Glenn Gould Prize (1993), the award of the International Society for Performing Artists (1995), the Loyola Medal of Concordia University (1997), the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award (1997), the Praemium Imperiale World Art Award (1999), the UNESCO Music Prize (2000), the Toronto Musicians\\' Association Musician of the Year award (2001), and an honorary LLD from the University of the West Indies (2006).In 1999, Concordia University in Montreal renamed their Loyola-campus concert hall Oscar Peterson Concert Hall in his honour.[28]In 2005, Peterson celebrated his 80th birthday at the HMV flagship store in Toronto, where a crowd of about 200 gathered to celebrate with him. Longtime admirer and fellow Canadian Diana Krall sang \"Happy Birthday\" to him and also performed a vocal version of one of Peterson\\'s songs, \"When Summer Comes\". The lyrics for this version were written by Elvis Costello, Krall\\'s husband. Canada Post unveiled a commemorative postage stamp in Peterson\\'s honour. The event was covered by a live radio broadcast by Toronto jazz station JAZZ.FM.Peterson received the BBC-Radio Lifetime Achievement Award, London, United Kingdom.[29]\"Technique is something you use to make your ideas listenable\", he once told jazz writer Len Lyons. \"You learn to play the instrument so you have a musical vocabulary, and you practice to get your technique to the point you need to express yourself, depending on how heavy your ideas are\".\"Some may criticize Peterson for not advancing, for finding his niche and staying with it for an entire career, but while he may not be the most revolutionary artist in jazz, the documentary Music in the Key of Oscar demonstrates that breaking down barriers can be accomplished in more ways than one\".[30] \"He was a crystallizer, rather than an innovator\".[20]\"His hands could do things few piano players can do\", said pianist Bill King, who studied with Peterson at his music school. Because Peterson was a big man, standing six feet, three inches, he could stretch his hands over a keyboard in a way few musicians can match.[31]Ray Charles, in Martin Scorsese Presents the Blues - Piano Blues (2003), commented that Peterson was the only other piano player who could come close to the technical skills of Art Tatum, praising his abilities with \"Oscar could play like a motherfucker!\"Piano manufacturer Bösendorfer released a limited edition Oscar Peterson Signature Edition Piano in honour of the 90th anniversary of Peterson\\'s birth. Each of the 12 pianos of this limited edition has built-in Yamaha Disklavier E3 technology that will play 12 compositions recorded by Peterson in 1980. The recordings captured key and pedal data of those performances and were then remastered for the Peterson Limited Edition so that the Disklavier can play one of these musical compositions as Peterson would have done in 1980.[32]One of the signature pianos is located in the lobby of the Arts Commons (formerly, Epcor Centre for the Performing Arts) in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, where it will be used by performers and also to play the 12 recorded performances by Peterson. The piano was inaugurated at a gala performance on April 2, 2016, by Tommy Banks and the Peterson performances. Peterson\\'s widow, Kelly, was in attendance and said that “tears came to my eyes the first time I heard Oscar’s notes resonate from the piano”. [33]In 2008, Peterson was awarded, posthumously, the Special Achievement Award at the SOCAN Awards in Toronto.[34]While Peterson was recognized as a great jazz pianist both at home in Canada and internationally, he was also regarded in Canada as a distinguished public figure. His notable personage is evident in the acclaim and awards he received, particularly in the latter two decades of his life.He was made an Officer of the Order of Canada (the country\\'s highest civilian state order for talent and service) in 1972, and promoted to Companion of the order (the highest degree of merit and humanity), in 1984. He was also a member of the Order of Ontario, a Chevalier of the National Order of Quebec, and an officer of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres of France.From 1991 to 1994, Peterson was chancellor of York University in Toronto. The chancellor is the titular head of the university. Weeks after his death, the Province of Ontario announced a C$4\\xa0million scholarship for the \"Oscar Peterson Chair\" for Jazz Performance at York University with an additional C$1\\xa0million to be awarded annually in music scholarships to underprivileged York students in tribute to Peterson.[31]Peterson\\'s niece, television journalist Sylvia Sweeney, produced a documentary film, In the Key of Oscar, about Peterson in 1992.Unlike most other jazz musicians, Peterson was networked with Canadian elites in the later years of his life. For example, former Ontario premier Bob Rae recalled that in 2007, himself, Ontario Chief Justice Roy McMurtry, and former Ontario premier Bill Davis celebrated McMurtry\\'s retirement with Peterson, his wife, and their wives.[36]Peterson received honorary doctorates from many Canadian universities: Carleton University, Queen\\'s University, Concordia University, McMaster University, Mount Allison University, the University of Victoria, the University of Western Ontario, York University, the University of Toronto, and the Université Laval, as well as from Northwestern University and Niagara University in the United States. Concordia University\\'s main concert hall and performing arts venue is named after Peterson.In 2004, the City of Toronto named the courtyard of the Toronto-Dominion Centre Oscar Peterson Square. In 2005, the Peel District School Board in suburban Toronto opened the Oscar Peterson school in Mississauga, Ontario, two miles from his home. Peterson said, \"This is a most unexpected and moving tribute\".[37] He visited the school several times and donated electronic musical equipment to it.[20] Soon after Peterson\\'s death, the University of Toronto Mississauga opened a major student residence in March 2008 as \"Oscar Peterson Hall\".[38] He won the Civic Award of Merit, the City of Mississauga\\'s highest honour, in 2003. He moved to Mississauga c.\\u20091971.[39]Former Canadian prime minister Jean Chrétien wanted in 1993 to put Peterson forward to the Governor General of Canada for appointment to the post of Lieutenant Governor of Ontario, but Peterson felt that his health could not stand up to the many ceremonial duties that this position would require. \"He was the most famous Canadian in the world\", said Chrétien. Chrétien also said that Nelson Mandela glowed when meeting Peterson. \"It was very emotional. They were both moved to meet each other. These were two men with humble beginnings who rose to very illustrious levels\".[40]A memorial concert, held on January 12, 2008, filled the 2500-seat Roy Thomson Hall in Toronto. People had queued for more than three hours to get in. Governor General Michaëlle Jean reported at the concert that \"thousands\" more could not get in. Among the performers were Grégory Charles, Herbie Hancock, Quincy Jones, Phil Nimmons and singers Audrey Morris and Nancy Wilson. The \"Oscar Peterson\" quartet played key pieces; they were Monty Alexander, Jeff Hamilton, Ulf Wakenius and Dave Young. All toured with Peterson during his late \"one-handed\" period, except Alexander. The Nathaniel Dett Chorale, University of Toronto Gospel Choir[41] and Sharon Riley & the Faith Chorale, under the direction of Andrew Craid along with opera soprano Measha Brueggergosman closed the show, singing an excerpt from Peterson\\'s \"Hymn to Freedom\".[21][42]A movement was begun on Facebook to rename the Lionel-Groulx Metro station, a transfer station between Montreal\\'s Green Line and Orange Line, in honour of Oscar Peterson. The Montreal Transit Corporation, however, refused to end its moratorium on renaming Metro stations. The city\\'s policy on landmark tributes is to wait at least a year after a public figure\\'s death.[43][44][45][46]An Ontario school named Oscar Peterson Public School was opened in Stouffville in the Regional Municipality of York on April 30, 2009,[47] and commenced operation in the 2009–10 school year. In June 2010 a life size bronze statue of Peterson was unveiled in Ottawa by Queen Elizabeth II during her royal tour of Canada.[48]', 'OtisSpann': 'Otis Spann (March 21, 1930 – April 24, 1970)[3] was an American blues musician, whom many consider to be the leading postwar Chicago blues pianist.[2][4]Sources differ over Spann\\'s early years. Many sources state that he was born in Jackson, Mississippi, in 1930,[5][6] but the researchers Bob Eagle and Eric LeBlanc concluded, on the basis of census records and other official information, that he was born in 1924 in Belzoni, Mississippi.[7]Spann\\'s father was, according to some sources, a pianist called Friday Ford. His mother, Josephine Erby, was a guitarist who had worked with Memphis Minnie and Bessie Smith, and his stepfather, Frank Houston Spann, was a preacher and musician. One of five children, Spann began playing the piano at the age of seven, with some instruction from Friday Ford, Frank Spann, and Little Brother Montgomery.[8]By the age of 14, he was playing in bands in the Jackson area. He moved to Chicago in 1946, where he was mentored by Big Maceo Merriweather. Spann performed as a solo act and with the guitarist Morris Pejoe, working a regular spot at the Tic Toc Lounge.[3] Spann became known for his distinctive piano style. He replaced Merriweather as Muddy Waters\\'s piano player in late 1952 and participated in his first recording session with the band on September 24, 1953.[9] He continued to record as a solo artist and session player with other musicians, including Bo Diddley and Howlin\\' Wolf, during his tenure with the group. He stayed with Waters until 1968.[10]Spann\\'s work for Chess Records includes the 1954 single \"It Must Have Been the Devil\" backed with \"Five Spot\", with B.B. King and Jody Williams on guitars. During his time at Chess he played on a few of Chuck Berry\\'s early records, including the studio version of \"You Can\\'t Catch Me\". In 1956, he recorded two unreleased tracks with Big Walter Horton and Robert Lockwood.[11] He recorded a session with the guitarist Robert Lockwood, Jr. and vocalist St. Louis Jimmy in New York on August 23, 1960, which was issued on the albums Otis Spann Is the Blues and Walking the Blues. A 1963 session for Storyville Records was recorded in Copenhagen. He worked with Waters and Eric Clapton on recordings for Decca[12] and with James Cotton for Prestige in 1964.The Blues Is Where It\\'s At, Spann\\'s 1966 album for ABC-Bluesway, includes contributions from George \"Harmonica\" Smith, Waters, and Sammy Lawhorn. The Bottom of the Blues (1967), featuring Spann\\'s wife, Lucille Spann (June 23, 1938 – August 2, 1994),[13] was released by Bluesway. He worked on albums with Buddy Guy, Big Mama Thornton, Peter Green, and Fleetwood Mac in the late 1960s. In 2012, Silk City Records released Someday which featured live and studio performances from 1967 produced by the noted blues guitarist Son Lewis.DVD recordings of Spann include his performances at the Newport Jazz Festival (1960), the American Folk Blues Festival (1963), the Blues Masters (1966), and the Copenhagen Jazz Festival (1968).Spann died of liver cancer in Chicago in 1970. He was buried in Burr Oak Cemetery, in Alsip, Illinois. His grave was unmarked for almost thirty years, until Steve Salter (president of the Killer Blues Headstone Project) wrote a letter to Blues Revue magazine, saying, \"This piano great is lying in an unmarked grave. Let\\'s do something about this deplorable situation\". Blues enthusiasts from around the world sent donations to purchase a headstone. On June 6, 1999, the marker was unveiled in a private ceremony. The stone is inscribed, \"Otis played the deepest blues we ever heard – He\\'ll play forever in our hearts\".In 1972, the site of the Ann Arbor Blues and Jazz Festival was named \"Otis Spann Memorial Field\".[14]He was posthumously elected to the Blues Hall of Fame in 1980.John Lee Hooker \"Live at Cafe au Go-Go. Muddy Waters, Otis Spann, Sammy Lawhorn, Luther Johnson, Mac Arnold, Francis Clay and George Smith (1967)', 'PeteJohnson': 'Pete Johnson (born Kermit H. Johnson, March 25, 1904 – March 23, 1967)[1][2] was an American boogie-woogie and jazz pianist.Journalist Tony Russell stated in his book The Blues – From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray that \"Johnson shared with the other members of the \\'Boogie Woogie Trio\\' the technical virtuosity and melodic fertility that can make this the most exciting of all piano music styles, but he was more comfortable than Meade Lux Lewis in a band setting; and as an accompanist, unlike Lewis or Albert Ammons, he could sparkle but not outshine his singing partner\".[3] Fellow journalist Scott Yanow (Allmusic) added \"Johnson was one of the three great boogie-woogie pianists (along with Lewis and Ammons) whose sudden prominence in the late 1930s helped make the style very popular\".[2]Johnson was born in Kansas City, Missouri.[2] He was raised by his mother after his father deserted the family. Things got so bad financially, Pete was placed in an orphanage when he was three. He became so homesick, however, that he ran away and returned living at home. By the age of 12, he sought out work to ease some of the financial burden at home. He worked various jobs; in a factory, a print shop, and as a shoe-shiner. He dropped out of school in the fifth grade as a result of his efforts.[4]Johnson began his musical career in 1922 as a drummer in Kansas City.[3] He began piano about the same time he was learning the drums. His early piano practices took place in a church, where he was working as a water boy for a construction company.[5] From 1926 to 1938 he worked as a pianist, often working with Big Joe Turner.[2] An encounter with record producer John Hammond in 1936 led to an engagement at the Famous Door in New York City. In 1938 Johnson and Turner appeared in the From Spirituals to Swing concert at Carnegie Hall. After this show the popularity of the boogie-woogie style was on the upswing. Johnson worked locally and toured and recorded with Turner, Meade Lux Lewis, and Albert Ammons during this period.[2] Lewis, Ammons, and Johnson appeared in the film short Boogie-Woogie Dream in 1941.[3]The song \"Roll \\'Em Pete\" (composed by Johnson and Turner),[6] featuring Turner on vocals and Johnson on piano, was one of the first rock and roll records. Another self-referential title was their \"Johnson and Turner Blues.\" In 1949, he also wrote and recorded \"Rocket 88 Boogie,\" a two-sided instrumental, which influenced the 1951 Ike Turner hit, \"Rocket 88\".In the late 1940s, Johnson recorded an early concept album, House Rent Party, in which he starts out playing alone, supposedly in a new empty house, and is joined there by J. C. Higgenbotham, J. C. Heard, and other Kansas City players. Each has a solo single backed by Johnson, and then the whole group plays a jam session together. On this album Johnson shows his considerable command of stride piano and his ability to work with a group.At a nightclub in Niagara Falls, the piano was on a platform above the bar, and Johnson had to climb a ladder to get there.[3]In 1950 he moved to Buffalo.[7] He encountered some health and financial problems in this period, including losing part of a finger in an accident and being partially paralyzed by a stroke. Between January and October 1953 he was employed by an ice cream company washing trucks, but supplemented his income by performing in a trio which played at the Bamboo Room in Buffalo on weekends. Johnson experienced more of the same the following year, 1954. He washed cars at a mortuary for $25 a week. In July, however, a nice job came his way at the St. Louis Forest Park Hotel, a six-week engagement as resident pianist at the Circus Snack Bar. Some broadcasts were made on Saturday afternoons in a program called Saturday at the Chase. Johnson was also privately recorded July 20 and August 1 at a pair of house parties arranged at the home of Bill Atkinson, a close friend (in print as of this writing). Things remained somewhat bleak for the next four years, except for three appearances in 1955 at the Berkshire Music Barn in Lenox, MA.[8] But he continued to record, and toured Europe in 1958 with the Jazz at the Philharmonic ensemble, despite the fact that he was not feeling well.[2][3][9] While in Europe he received an invitation to appear at the Newport Jazz Festival, which he did upon his return to the States, accompanying Big Joe Turner, Chuck Berry and Big Maybelle. Johnson underwent a physical examination in August which revealed a heart condition as well as diabetes. Several strokes followed, resulting in complete loss of mobility in both hands. Four years after the series of strokes he was still disabled and was beginning to lose his eyesight. Jazz Report magazine ran a series of record auctions to raise money for Pete. In 1964, a longtime correspondent of Johnson\\'s, Hans Maurer, published The Pete Johnson Story. All sales proceeds went to Pete. After an article appeared in a 1964 issue of Blues Unlimited detailing Johnson\\'s difficulty in receiving royalty payments other than from Blue Note and Victor, in June Pete was accepted as a member of ASCAP, which finally ensured that some of the royalties would be received on a regular basis.His final live appearance was the Spirituals to Swing concert at Carnegie Hall in January 1967, his eighth and final appearance at this event.[10][11] A review of the concert by Dan Morgenstern of Down Beat: \"Then for the concert\\'s most moving moment, Lieberson (the MC) escorted Pete Johnson on stage and introduced him as one of the participants in the original Spirituals to Swing and the greatest boogie-woogie pianist. Johnson had suffered a series of paralytic strokes and had not played piano for many years. His old buddy, Turner, took him by the hand, and for a moment the two middle-aged men looked touchingly like little boys. Turner dedicated \\'Roll \\'Em Pete\\' to his old friend, as Lieberson and Johnson were about to leave the stage. Instead, they stopped and the pianist seated himself next to Bryant at the piano and began to play the treble part of his old showpiece, Bryant handling the bass. Johnson was a bit shaky but game, gaining in confidence as the number built in intensity.\"[12] Pete Johnson died two months later in Meyer Hospital, Buffalo, New York, in March 1967, at the age of 62.[13]|| indicates in print, as of February 2009', 'PianoRed': 'Willie Lee Perryman (October 19, 1911 – July 25, 1985),[1] usually known professionally as Piano Red and later in life as Dr. Feelgood, was an American blues musician, the first to hit the pop music charts. He was a self-taught pianist who played in the barrelhouse blues style (a loud percussive type of blues piano suitable for noisy bars or taverns). His performing and recording careers emerged during the period of transition from completely segregated \"race music\" to rhythm and blues, which was marketed to both white and black audiences. Some music historians credit Perryman\\'s 1950 recording \"Rocking With Red\" for the popularization of the term rock and roll in Atlanta.[2] His simple, hard-pounding left hand and his percussive right hand, coupled with his cheerful shout, brought him considerable success over three decades.Perryman was born on a farm near Hampton, Georgia, where his parents, Ada and Henry Perryman, were sharecroppers. He was part of a large family, though sources differ on exactly how many brothers and sisters he had. Perryman was an albino African American, as was his older brother Rufus, who also had a blues piano career as \"Speckled Red\".[2]When Perryman was six years old, his father gave up farming and moved the family to Atlanta, where he worked in a factory. Not much is known about Perryman\\'s education or early life, but he recalled that his mother bought a piano for her two albino sons. Both brothers had very poor vision, an effect of their albinism, so neither took formal music lessons, but they developed their barrelhouse style through playing by ear. Perryman sometimes recalled imitating Rufus\\'s style after watching him play, but it is doubtful that his brother was a major influence. Rufus, nineteen years older than Perryman, left Georgia in 1925 and did not return until a 1960 visit. Another influence that Perryman cited in interviews was Fats Waller, whose records his mother brought home. Other influences were likely the local blues pianists playing at \"house\" or \"rent\" parties, which were common community fund-raisers of that era.[2]By the early 1930s, Perryman was playing at house parties, juke joints, and barrelhouses in Georgia, Alabama, and Tennessee. He developed his percussive playing style and harsh singing style to compensate for the lack of sound systems and to overcome the noise of people talking in venues. He worked these circuits with other Georgia bluesmen, including Barbecue Bob, Charlie Hicks, Curley Weaver, and \"Blind Willie\" McTell.[2]Perryman married in the early 1930s, and he and his wife, Flora, had two daughters. He obtained seasonal employment performing in Brevard, North Carolina, a mountain resort town, and commuted back and forth between there and Atlanta. The Brevard job brought him before white audiences; by 1934 he had also begun to play at white clubs in Atlanta. In Atlanta he would play at a white club until midnight and then head over to an African-American club, where he would play until 4 a.m. Perryman developed a repertoire of pop standards, which were more popular among the white audiences, while continuing his blues sets in African-American clubs.[2]Around 1936 he began to be billed as \"Piano Red\". He made his first recordings with McTell in Augusta for Vocalion Records, but they were never released. He also began working as an upholsterer, a trade which he occasionally maintained through later years.[2]In 1950, after spending the previous 14 years upholstering and playing music on weekends, Perryman recorded \"Rockin\\' with Red\" and \"Red\\'s Boogie\" at the WGST radio studios in Atlanta for RCA Victor. Both songs became national hits, reaching numbers five and three, respectively, on the Billboard R&B chart, and \"Rockin\\' with Red\" has since been covered many times under many titles. This success, along with the further hits \"The Wrong Yo Yo\" (allegedly written by Speckled Red), \"Laying the Boogie\" and \"Just Right Bounce\", allowed him to resume an active performing schedule. He also recorded sessions in New York City and Nashville during the early 1950s.Red played for white teenagers\\' high school parties in people\\'s homes in Atlanta. Patrons would arrange for him to be picked up at his home and returned and would provide a \"bottle\" of booze for him and a modest fee.During the mid-1950s, Perryman also worked as a disc jockey on radio stations WGST and WAOK in Atlanta, broadcasting The Piano Red Show (later The Dr. Feelgood Show) directly from a shack in his back yard. A young James Brown made an appearance on his show in the late 1950s. Perryman\\'s involvement had him appearing on a flatbed truck in many parades, which led to his song \"Peachtree Parade\". From the mid-1950s until the late 1960s, he recorded for several record labels, including Columbia, for which he made several records; Checker, for which he recorded eight sides with Willie Dixon on bass; and Groove Records, a subsidiary of RCA Victor, producing the first hit for that label.[3]Signed to Okeh Records in 1961, Perryman began using the name Dr. Feelgood and the Interns, releasing several hits, including the much-covered \"Doctor Feelgood\". The persona was one he had initially adopted on his radio shows. The new career was short-lived, though, and he was never able to regain his former stature. In 1963, the The Merseybeats recorded a cover of the B-side of \"Doctor Feelgood,\" entitled \"Mr. Moonlight\" (written by Roy Lee Johnson) as the B-side of their UK top 5 hit \"I Think of You\". It was also recorded by the Beatles and appeared on the album Beatles for Sale in the United Kingdom and on the album Beatles \\'65 in the United States. In 1966, the Lovin\\' Spoonful recorded his song \"Bald Headed Lena\" on their second album, Daydream.Perryman continued to be a popular performer in Underground Atlanta. He made several European tours late in his career, including appearances at the Montreux Jazz Festival, the Berlin Jazz Festival, and the inauguration of Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, and he also performed on BBC Radio. During this time, he was befriended by Bill Wyman, Keith Richards, Mick Jagger, Eric Clapton, and Paul McCartney, and Pete Ham of Badfinger wrote a song in his honor.Muhlenbrink\\'s Saloon closed in 1979, and Perryman found himself without a regular job. That lasted until 1981, when he was hired to perform five nights a week at the Excelsior Mill in Atlanta. In 1984, he asked co-owner Michael Reeves to arrange a live recording, and Reeves arranged for a mobile recording in October of that year.In 1985, Perryman recorded the song \"Yo Yo\", a duet with Danny Shirley, who was later the lead singer of the band Confederate Railroad. The record reached the natinal chart in that year.Perryman was diagnosed with cancer that same year. He died in July 1985 at Dekalb General Hospital in Decatur, Georgia. Among those who attended his funeral were the governor of Georgia and the mayor of Atlanta.[4]The tapes from the Excelsior Mill remained in Reeves\\'s possession for twenty-five years. In April 2010, he formed a partnership with the writer and producer David Fulmer to release a CD of the recording under the title The Lost Atlanta Tapes. The CD was released by Landslide Records on August 17, 2010.Piano Red\\'s song \"Dr. Feelgood\" was covered by several UK beat groups, including the Beatles and Johnny Kidd & the Pirates, who recorded it as the B-side of their 1964 single \"Always and Ever\".[5]', 'PinetopPerkins': 'Joseph William \"Pinetop\" Perkins (July 7, 1913\\xa0– March 21, 2011) was an American blues pianist. He played with some of the most influential blues and rock-and-roll performers of his time and received numerous honors, including a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and induction into the Blues Hall of Fame.Perkins was born in Belzoni, Mississippi.[1] He began his career as a guitarist but then injured the tendons in his left arm in a fight with a chorus girl in Helena, Arkansas.[2] Unable to play the guitar, he switched to the piano. He also switched from Robert Nighthawk\\'s radio program on KFFA to Sonny Boy Williamson\\'s King Biscuit Time.[3] He continued working with Nighthawk, however, accompanying him on \"Jackson Town Gal\" in 1950.In the 1950s, Perkins joined Earl Hooker and began touring. He recorded \"Pinetop\\'s Boogie Woogie\" (written by Pinetop Smith and originally recorded by him in 1928) at Sam Phillips\\'s Sun Studio, in Memphis, Tennessee (\"They used to call me Pinetop,\" he recalled, \"because I played that song\").[4]Perkins then relocated to Illinois and left the music business until Hooker persuaded him to record again in 1968. Perkins replaced Otis Spann in the Muddy Waters band when Spann left the band in 1969.[3] After ten years with that organization, he formed the Legendary Blues Band with Willie \"Big Eyes\" Smith, recording from the late 1970s to the early 1990s.[3]Perkins played a brief musical cameo on the street outside Aretha\\'s Soul Food Cafe in the 1980 movie The Blues Brothers, having an argument with John Lee Hooker over who wrote \"Boom Boom.\" He also appeared in the 1987 movie Angel Heart as a member of guitarist Toots Sweet\\'s band.Perkins was a sideman on countless recordings but never had an album devoted solely to his artistry until After Hours, released by Blind Pig Records in 1988.[5] The tour in support of the album featured Jimmy Rogers and guitarist Hubert Sumlin. In 1998 Perkins released the album Legends, featuring Sumlin.Perkins was driving his automobile in 2004 in La Porte, Indiana, when his car was hit by a train. The car was wrecked, but the 91-year-old driver was not seriously hurt. Until his death, Perkins lived in Austin, Texas. He usually performed a couple of nights a week at Momo\\'s, on Sixth Street. In 2005, he received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.In 2008, Perkins, together with Henry Townsend, Robert Lockwood, Jr. and David \"Honeyboy\" Edwards, received a Grammy Award for Best Traditional Blues Album for Last of the Great Mississippi Delta Bluesmen: Live in Dallas. He was also nominated in the same category for his solo album Pinetop Perkins on the 88\\'s: Live in Chicago.The song \"Hey Mr. Pinetop Perkins\", performed by Perkins and Angela Strehli, played on the common misconception that he wrote \"Pinetop\\'s Boogie Woogie\":At the age of 97, Perkins won a Grammy Award in the category Best Traditional Blues Album for Joined at the Hip, which he recorded with Willie \"Big Eyes\" Smith, thus becoming the oldest winner of a Grammy Award,[6] edging out the comedian George Burns, who had won in the spoken word category 21 years earlier (Perkins, at the age of 90, had tied with Burns in 2004).[7]A little more than a month later, on March 21, 2011, Perkins died at his home in Austin.[6] At the time of his death, he had more than 20 performances booked for 2011. Shortly before he died, while discussing his late career resurgence with an interviewer, he conceded, \"I can\\'t play piano like I used to either. I used to have bass rolling like thunder. I can\\'t do that no more. But I ask the Lord, please forgive me for the stuff I done trying to make a nickel.\"[citation needed] He and David \"Honeyboy\" Edwards were the last surviving original Delta blues musicians. Perkins was also one of the last surviving bluesmen to have known Robert Johnson.[8]Perkins in Paris, France, November 7, 1976Perkins at the Blues Festival in Santa Cruz, 2008Perkins at the Master Musicians Festival in Somerset, Kentucky, July 19, 2008David \"Honeyboy\" Edwards and Perkins at the Master Musicians Festival in Somerset, KentuckyPerkins in Austin, Texas, May 19, 2008', 'PinetopSmith': 'Clarence Smith, better known as Pinetop Smith or Pine Top Smith[1] (June 11, 1904 – March 15, 1929) was an American boogie-woogie style blues pianist. His hit tune, \"Pine Top\\'s Boogie Woogie\", featured rhythmic \"breaks\" that were an essential ingredient of ragtime music.[2]He was a posthumous 1991 inductee of the Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame.Smith was born in Troy, Alabama and raised in Birmingham, Alabama.[1] He received his nickname as a child from his liking for climbing trees.[3] In 1920 he moved to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,[4] where he worked as an entertainer before touring on the T. O. B. A. vaudeville circuit, performing as a singer and comedian as well as a pianist. For a time he worked as accompanist for blues singer Ma Rainey[1] and Butterbeans and Susie.In the mid-1920s he was recommended by Cow Cow Davenport to J. Mayo Williams at Vocalion Records, and in 1928 he moved, with his wife and young son, to Chicago, Illinois to record.[1] For a time he, Albert Ammons, and Meade Lux Lewis lived in the same rooming house.On 29 December 1928 he recorded his influential \"Pine Top\\'s Boogie Woogie\", one of the first \"boogie woogie\" style recordings to make a hit, and which cemented the name for the style. Pine Top talks over the recording, telling how to dance to the number.[2] He said he originated the number at a house-rent party in St. Louis, Missouri. Smith was the first ever to direct \"the girl with the red dress on\" to \"not move a peg\" until told to \"shake that thing\" and \"mess around\". Similar lyrics are heard in many later songs, including \"Mess Around\" and \"What\\'d I Say\" by Ray Charles.Smith was scheduled to make another recording session for Vocalion in 1929, but died from a gunshot wound in a dance-hall fight in Chicago the day before the session.[1] Sources differ as to whether he was the intended recipient of the bullet. \"I saw Pinetop spit blood\" was the famous headline in Down Beat magazine.At least two photographs of Smith are known to exist.Smith was acknowledged by other boogie-woogie pianists such as Albert Ammons and Pete Johnson as a key influence, and he gained posthumous fame when \"Boogie Woogie\" was arranged for big band and recorded by Tommy Dorsey and His Orchestra in 1938.[2] Although not immediately successful, \"Boogie Woogie\" was so popular during and after World War II[5] that it became Dorsey\\'s best-selling record, with over five million copies sold. Bing Crosby and Count Basie also recorded their versions of the song.[2]From the 1950s, Joe Willie Perkins became universally known as \"Pinetop Perkins\" for his recording of \"Pinetop\\'s Boogie Woogie\".[6] Perkins later became Muddy Waters\\'s pianist. When he was in his nineties, he recorded a song on his 2004 album Ladies\\' Man, which played on the by-then common misconception that he had written \"Pinetop\\'s Boogie Woogie\".Ray Charles adapted \"Pine Top\\'s Boogie Woogie\" for his song \"Mess Around\", for which the authorship was credited to \"A. Nugetre\", Ahmet Ertegun.In 1975, the Bob Thiele Orchestra recorded a modern jazz album called I Saw Pinetop Spit Blood, which included a treatment of \"Pinetop\\'s Boogie Woogie\" as well as the title song.Gene Taylor recorded a version of \"Pinetop\\'s Boogie Woogie\" on his eponymous 2003 album.[7]Claes Oldenburg, the pop artist, proposed a Pinetop Smith Monument in his book Proposals for Monuments and Buildings 1965–69. Oldenburg described the monument as \"a wire extending the length of North Avenue, west from Clark Street, along which at intervals runs an electric impulse colored blue so that there’s one blue line as far as the eye can see. Pinetop Smith invented boogie woogie blues at the corner of North and Larrabee, where he finally was murdered: the electric wire is \\'blue\\' and dangerous.\"[8]', 'ProfessorLonghair': 'Henry Byrd redirects here. For those of a similar name, see Harry Byrd (disambiguation) or Henry Bird (disambiguation)Henry Roeland \"Roy\" Byrd (December 19, 1918 – January 30, 1980), better known as Professor Longhair, was a New Orleans blues singer and pianist. He was active in two distinct periods, first in the heyday of early rhythm and blues and later in the resurgence of interest in traditional jazz after the founding of the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival in 1970. His piano style has been described as \"instantly recognizable, combining rumba, mambo, and calypso.\"[1]The music journalist Tony Russell (in his book The Blues: From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray) wrote that \"The vivacious rhumba-rhythmed piano blues and choked singing typical of Fess were too weird to sell millions of records; he had to be content with siring musical offspring who were simple enough to manage that, like Fats Domino or Huey \"Piano\" Smith. But he is also acknowledged as a father figure by subtler players like Allen Toussaint and Dr. John.\"[2][3]Byrd was born on December 19, 1918, in Bogalusa, Louisiana.[2] His distinctive style of piano playing was influenced by learning to play on an instrument that was missing some keys.[2]He began his career in New Orleans in 1948. Mike Tessitore, owner of the Caldonia Club, gave Longhair his stage name.[4] Longhair first recorded in a band called the Shuffling Hungarians in 1949, creating four songs (including the first version of his signature song, \"Mardi Gras in New Orleans\") for the Star Talent record label. Union problems curtailed their release, but Longhair\\'s next effort for Mercury Records the same year was a winner.[4] Throughout the 1950s, he recorded for Atlantic Records, Federal Records and local labels. Professor Longhair had only one national commercial hit, \"Bald Head\", in 1950, under the name Roy Byrd and His Blues Jumpers.[4] He also recorded his favorites, \"Tipitina\" and \"Go to the Mardi Gras\".[2] However, he lacked crossover appeal among white audiences.[2]After suffering a stroke, Professor Longhair recorded \"No Buts – No Maybes\" in 1957.[4] He re-recorded \"Go to the Mardi Gras\" in 1959.[4]He first recorded \"Big Chief\" with its composer, Earl King, in 1964. In the 1960s, Professor Longhair\\'s career faltered.[2] He became a janitor to support himself and fell into a gambling habit.[5]He appeared at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival in 1971 and at the Newport Jazz Festival and the Montreux Jazz Festival in 1973.[2] His album The London Concert showcases work he did on a visit to the United Kingdom.By the 1980s his albums, such as Crawfish Fiesta on Alligator Records and New Orleans Piano on Atlantic Records, had become readily available across America.[5] He appeared on the PBS series Soundstage (with Dr. John, Earl King, and the Meters) in 1974 and co-starred in the film documentary Piano Players Rarely Ever Play Together.[4] Longhair died of a heart attack while filming was under way.[4][5] Footage from his funeral was included.[4]Professor Longhair was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1981. He was awarded a posthumous Grammy Award for his early recordings released as House Party New Orleans Style. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992.[6]The B-side of the 1985 Paul McCartney single \"Spies Like Us\", entitled \"My Carnival\", credited to McCartney and Wings, was recorded in New Orleans and dedicated to Professor Longhair.His song \"Tipitina\" was covered by Hugh Laurie on the 2011 CD album Let Them Talk. Laurie is a long-time fan, having used Longhair\\'s \"Go to the Mardi Gras\" as the theme for the pilot episode of A Bit of Fry & Laurie.In the 1940s, Professor Longhair was playing with Caribbean musicians, listening a lot to Perez Prado\\'s mambo records, and absorbing and experimenting with it all.[7] He was especially enamored with Cuban music. Longhair\\'s style was known locally as \"rumba-boogie\".[8] Alexander Stewart stated that Longhair was a key figure bridging the worlds of boogie-woogie and the new style of rhythm and blues.[9] In his composition \"Misery,\" Professor Longhair played a habanera-like figure in his left hand. The deft use of triplets in the right hand is a characteristic of Longhair\\'s style.Tresillo, the habanera, and related African-based single-celled figures have long been heard in the left hand-part of piano compositions by New Orleans musicians, such as Louis Moreau Gottschalk (\"Souvenirs from Havana\", 1859) and Jelly Roll Morton (\"The Crave\", 1910). One of Longhair\\'s great contributions was the adaptation of Afro-Cuban two-celled, clave-based patterns in New Orleans blues. Michael Campbell stated, \"Rhythm and blues influenced by Afro-Cuban music first surfaced in New Orleans. Professor Longhair\\'s influence was\\xa0... far reaching. In several of his early recordings, Professor Longhair blended Afro-Cuban rhythms with rhythm and blues. The most explicit is \\'Longhair\\'s Blues Rhumba,\\' where he overlays a straightforward blues with a clave rhythm.\"[10] The guajeo-like piano part for the rumba-boogie \"Mardi Gras in New Orleans\" (1949) employs the 2-3 clave onbeat/offbeat motif.[11] The 2-3 clave time line is written above the piano excerpt for reference.According to Dr. John (Malcolm John \"Mac\" Rebennack, Jr.), the Professor \"put funk into music\\xa0... Longhair\\'s thing had a direct bearing I\\'d say on a large portion of the funk music that evolved in New Orleans.\"[12] This is the syncopated, but straight subdivision feel of Cuban music (as opposed to swung subdivisions). Alexander Stewart stated that the popular feel was passed along from \"New Orleans—through James Brown\\'s music, to the popular music of the 1970s,\" adding, \"The singular style of rhythm & blues that emerged from New Orleans in the years after World War II played an important role in the development of funk. In a related development, the underlying rhythms of American popular music underwent a basic, yet generally unacknowledged transition from triplet or shuffle feel to even or straight eighth notes.[13] Concerning funk motifs, Stewart stated, \"This model, it should be noted, is different from a time line (such as clave and tresillo) in that it is not an exact pattern, but more of a loose organizing principle.\"[14]Black or white, local or out-of-town, they all had Longhair\\'s music in common. Just that mambo-rhumba boogie thing.', 'RobAgerbeek': 'Robbert Arris Jules \"Rob\" Agerbeek (born 28 September 1937 in Batavia (Jakarta)) is an Indo Dutch boogie-woogie and jazz pianist and winner of several jazz concourses in the Netherlands in the late 1950s.[1] He is regarded as one of Europe\\'s finest jazz pianists, covering the full spectrum of jazz styles from his early days of Boogie-woogie to Chicago traditional Jazz, swing and contemporary jazz.[2]In 1954 Rob Agerbeek and his family arrived in the Netherlands. He started playing the piano at the age of 17 or 18. Except for one piano lesson from his mother he is completely self-taught; he learned the piano by listening to records of Albert Ammons, Johnny Maddox, Winifred Atwell, Pete Johnson and Meade Lux Lewis.[3] In the first years of his career Agerbeek is mainly into Boogie-woogie and later in his career he expands his playing styles with bebop, hardbop and dixieland. He accompanied more than hundred, mainly American, Jazz musicians such as Ben Webster, Hank Mobley, Dexter Gordon, George Coleman, Johnny Griffin and Gene Ammons.[4] Rob Agerbeek performed at international jazzfestivals as the Paris Jazz Festival, Hammerveld Jazz Festival, North Sea Jazz Festival, Kongsberg Jazz Festival and the Berlin Jazz Festival.[5]On 17 November 1996 Agerbeek celebrated his 40 years jubilee as an allround jazz pianist when he was presented with the membership of honour of the Hague Jazz Club.[6]Rob Agerbeek still occasionally performs with his trio consisting of himself on piano and Ben Schröder on drums and Alex Milo on bass. Joining in on vocals on several performances are Jazz singer Mirjam van Dam,[7] Susanne de Rooij[8] and Brigitte Soffner.Rob Agerbeek\\'s discography of over 40 albums include a double LP with Dexter Gordon live at the Haagse Jazz Club, five CDs with the Dutch Swing College Band and 10 recordings with his own bands[2] of which three on the Oldie Blues label.[9]', 'RobertShawbluesmusician': 'Robert Shaw (August 9, 1908 – May 18, 1985) was an American blues and boogie-woogie pianist,[1] best known for his 1963 album, The Ma Grinder.Shaw was born in Stafford, Texas, the son of farm owners Jesse and Hettie Shaw, who owned a farm there. The family also owned a Steinway grand piano, and his sisters had lessons in playing, but Shaw\\'s father was against allowing his son to learn the instrument.[2]Shaw worked with his father on the family\\'s ranch, and played the piano whenever his family was out; the first song he learned was \"Aggravatin\\' Papa Don\\'t You Try to Two-Time Me.\" In adolescence, Shaw travelled to Houston to listen to jazz musicians, and at nearby roadhouses. He then found a piano teacher and paid for lessons with his earnings.[2]He learned a barrelhouse style of playing from musicians in the Fourth Ward, Houston. In the 1920s Shaw was part of the \"Santa Fe Circuit\", named after touring musicians utilising the Santa Fe freight trains. Although he played in Chicago, Shaw mainly restricted himself to Texas, performing as a soloist in the clubs and roadhouses of Sugarland, Richmond, Kingsville, Houston and Dallas. In 1930, at the height of the Kilgore oil boom, Shaw played there. Two years later he traveled to Kansas City, Kansas, to perform.[2] In 1933 he hosted a radio show in Oklahoma City. He relocated to Texas,[3] first to Fort Worth and then to Austin. Here he settled down and took up residence, owning a grocery store known as the Stop and Swat.[2]Shaw married Martha Landrum in December 1939. They had no children. However, Shaw had previously been married, and had a daughter, Verna Mae, and a son, William. For many years Shaw ran his grocery in Austin in partnership with Martha, and in 1962 he was named the black businessman of the year in Austin.[2]In 1963, Shaw recorded an album, Texas Barrelhouse Piano, which was produced by Robert \"Mack\" McCormick and released by McCormick\\'s Almanac Book and Recording Company. Arhoolie Records later reissued the LP under the title The Ma Grinder.[3] The album contained old favourites such as \"The Ma Grinder\", \"The Cows\" and \"Whores Is Funky\", some of them too risque to have been issued previously.[4]In 1967, seven years before his retirement from the grocery trade, Shaw recommenced concert playing. With the revival of his career, he played at the Kerrville Folk Festival, overseas in Amsterdam, Frankfurt, and at the Berlin Jazz Festival; as well as the Smithsonian Institution\\'s American Folk Life Festival, the World\\'s Fair Expo in Canada, and the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival.[2] He played with the Preservation Hall Jazz Band at the 1973 Austin Aqua Festival,[2] and continued to perform in the United States and in Europe intermittently in the 1970s, turning up unexpectedly in California in 1981 to help Strachwitz celebrate Arhoolie\\'s 20th anniversary.[3]Shaw died of a heart attack in Austin, on May 16, 1985, and was interred at the Capital Memorial Gardens. Two weeks after his death, the Texas State Senate passed a resolution in honor of his contribution to the state\\'s musical heritage.[2]The music journalist Bill Dahl described \"The Cows\", a composition written and recorded by Shaw, as \"a piece of incredible complexity that would wilt anything less than a legitimate ivories master.\"[3] Tony Russell, in his book The Blues: From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray, cited The Ma Grinder as \"offering a uniquely clear view of a style and repertoire that almost escaped preservation.\"[4]', 'RobertWellscomposer': 'Robert Henry Arthur Wells (born 7 April 1962 in Stockholm, Sweden) is a Swedish pianist, composer and singer, best known for the musical Rhapsody in Rock\\xa0(sv), which contains elements of rock, classical and boogie-woogie.A child prodigy, Wells attended the Adolf Fredrik\\'s Music School in Stockholm at the age of 7 in 1969 and four years later, at the age of 11, became the youngest person ever to attend the Royal Swedish Academy of Music.[1] At the age of 16 in 1978, Wells won two major Swedish talent contests. Wells has also participated twice in Melodifestivalen.Wells was the musical director of two Swedish television shows. Wells appeared regularly on Så ska det låta, the Swedish version of The Lyrics Board.Wells\\'s first musical tour was with the Leningrad Orchestra in 1991.

For most of his life he played piano at rent parties in the city, although he also lived in East St. Louis for a while in the early 1920s.In 1929 he made his only series of recordings for Vocalion Records. These included \"Gettin\\' Dirty Just Shakin\\' That Thing\", renowned for its raunchy \"signifying\" lyrics, and \"Head Rag Hop\", featuring talking by Tampa Red and Frankie Jaxon.[3]\"Head Rag Hop\" also was released on the Brunswick Collector Series label, which read: \"Head Rag Hop\", Romeo Nelson, recorded September 1929.

At age 15, went on the road playing piano in a barrelhouse style of blues. Like many bluesmen of his time, he travelled around playing to all-male audiences in sawmill, turpentine and levee camps along the Mississippi River, gathering a repertoire of raw, sexually explicit material. His wanderings eventually brought him to St. Louis, Missouri, where he met St. Louis Jimmy Oden,[2] the writer of the blues standard \"Goin\\' Down Slow\".In 1929 he was spotted by a talent scout and sent to New York City to record for Okeh Records.[3] His first release was \"44 Blues\" which became a blues standard and his signature song.[3] He soon began recording for different labels under various names, including Easy Papa Johnson, Dobby Bragg, and Willie Kelly (for Victor Records from 1930 to 1933). During this period he befriended another blues musician, the singer Charlie \"Specks\" McFadden, and accompanied him on half of the McFadden\\'s recordings.[4] After he and Oden moved to Chicago, Sykes found his first period of fame when he signed a contract with Decca Records in 1934.[3] In 1943, he signed with Bluebird Records and recorded with the Honeydrippers.[5] Sykes and Oden continued their musical friendship into the 1960s.In Chicago, Sykes began to display an increasing urbanity in his songwriting, using an eight-bar blues pop gospel structure instead of the traditional twelve-bar blues. Despite the growing urbanity of his style, he gradually became less competitive in the post–World War II music scene. After his contract with RCA Victor expired, he recorded for smaller labels, such as United, until his opportunities ran out in the mid-1950s.[3]Sykes left Chicago in 1954 for New Orleans as electric blues was taking over the Chicago blues clubs. When he returned to recording in the 1960s, it was for labels such as Delmark, Bluesville, Storyville and Folkways, which were documenting the quickly passing blues history.[6] He lived out his final years in New Orleans, where he died from a heart attack[7] on July 17, 1983.[1]Sykes had a long career, spanning the pre-war and postwar eras. His pounding piano boogies and risqué lyrics characterize his contributions to the blues. He was responsible for influential blues songs such as \"44 Blues\", \"Driving Wheel\", and \"Night Time Is the Right Time\".[1]He was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1999[8] and the Gennett Records Walk of Fame in 2011.', 'RossPetot': 'Ross Petot is an American ragtime, jazz and stride pianist and composer.

At the peak of her fame in the immediate post-war era, she was known as the \"Queen of the Boogie-Woogie\" (ブギの女王?, Bugi no Joō).Shizuko Kasagi was born Shizuko Kamei (亀井 静子?) on 25 August 1914 in Ōkawa District, Kagawa, Japan. She originally took Shizuko Mikasa (三笠 静子?) as her stage name, but eventually changed the spelling of her name to 笠置 シズ子.Before World War II, Shizuko was one of the stars of the Japan Girls Opera Company. During the Occupation of Japan, she became a mega star singing songs influenced by American jazz and boogie woogie. She appeared in the 1948 film Drunken Angel directed by Akira Kurosawa. In 1957, Shizuko retired from singing and concentrated on her acting career.[citation needed]Kasagi died from ovarian cancer on 30 March 1985, aged 70.', 'SilvanZingg': 'Silvan Zingg (born 19 March 1973) is a Swiss boogie woogie, blues and Jazz pianist and founder in 2002 of the International Boogie Woogie festival in Lugano, Switzerland.[1]Silvan Zingg is called the \"Boogie Woogie Ambassador\"[citation needed]. He was born in Lugano to a musical family. Before he started school, he had learned to play the piano and was particularly inspired by the work of Afro-American blues pianists. After studies as a graphic designer he decided to become a professional musician. Zingg has since performed in more than 1,000 concerts in 30 countries: Switzerland, Germany, Liechtenstein, Austria, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, Luxembourg, Greece, Monaco, Andorra, the Vatican, Bulgaria, Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary, Sweden, England, Ireland, the USA, Canada, India, Arab Emirates, China, Russia, Mexico. He gave his first overseas solo concert at 18 years of age. He was the youngest pianist and only European at the Masters Of Blues & Boogie Woogie Piano Night in Charleston, South Carolina together with Jimmy Walker, Skeeter Brandon. He has performed in other American venues including the Cincinnati, Detroit, Newport Festivals. In November 2005 he performed with Chuck Berry in a sold out concert in Zurich. Silvan Zingg has played with such other Blues artists as Ray Charles, Memphis Slim, Sammy Price, Champion Jack Dupree, Katie Webster, Michel Petrucciani and Jimmy Walker. In 2011 Silvan Zingg was invited by festival promoter Claude Nobs to perform with B.B.King at the Montreux Jazz Festival. Among other on stage: Carlos Santana, John McLaughlin, Susan Tedeschi, Derek Trucks, Shemekia Copeland, Robert Randolph.His CD Boogie Woogie Triology won several awards, and was top selling CD on CDBaby for more than one year.[citation needed].In 2002, Zingg initiated the International Boogie Woogie Festival in Lugano. Since then it has been held annually in April and has attracted such entertainers as Little Willie Littlefield, Kenny \"Blues Boss\" Wayne, Carl Sonny Leyland, Mitch Woods, Axel Zwingenberger, Vince Weber, Joja Wendt, Jean Paul Amouroux, Michael Pewny and Chris Conz. In 2006, BBC World reported on the festival, which brought it world-wide attention. In November 2008, Silvan Zingg completed his first concert tour of China.In 2010, Zingg was invited to give a concert/lecture about the history of boogie woogie at the University of Texas in Brownsville.', 'SpeckledRed': 'Rufus George Perryman (October 23, 1892 – January 2, 1973),[2] known as Speckled Red, was an American blues and boogie-woogie piano player and singer[1] noted for his recordings of \"The Dirty Dozens\", exchanges of insults and vulgar remarks that have long been a part of African-American folklore.Speckled Red was born in Hampton, Georgia. He was the older brother of Piano Red. Their nicknames were derived from both men being albinos.[3] The brothers were separated by almost a generation and never recorded together. Speckled Red and Piano Red both played in a raucous goodtime barrelhouse boogie-woogie style, although Speckled Red played slow blues more often. Both recorded versions of \"The Right String (But the Wrong Yo-Yo)\", Speckled Red in 1930 and Piano Red, who had a hit with the song 20 years later.Prior to his birth the family had moved for brief periods to Detroit, Michigan, and then Atlanta, Georgia, after his father violated Jim Crow laws, before settling in Hampton, Georgia. The family, consisting of Perryman and seven brothers and sisters, had little musical background. Speckled Red was a self-taught piano player,[4] influenced primarily by his idol Fishtail and by Charlie Spand, James Hemingway and William Ezell and initially inspired by Paul Seminole in a movie theatre. He also learned to play the organ at his church.[5]By his mid-teens he was playing house parties and juke joints. He moved back to Detroit in his mid-20s to play anywhere he could, including nightclubs and brothels, and was noticed by a Brunswick Records talent scout just before he left for Memphis, Tennessee, where he was located by Jim Jackson.[6] It was here that he had his first recording sessions, resulting in two classics for Brunswick, \"Wilkins Street Stomp\" and the hit “The Dirty Dozens”. Although the lyrics were sung rather than spoken, with its elaborate wordplay and earthy subject matter, \"The Dirty Dozens\" is considered in some respects a precursor of rap music.\"I want all you women to fall in line\\n\"And shake yo shimmy like i\\'m shakin\\' mine\\n\"You shake yo shimmy and you shake it fast\\n\"If you can\\'t shake the shimmy, shake yo\\' yas yas yas\"\\n\\n\"You a dirty mistreater, a robber and a cheater\\n\"Stick you in a dozens and yo pappy is yo cousin\\n\"And yo mama do the lawdylawd\"The following year, 1930, he recorded again, this time in Chicago, Illinois, resulting in most notably “The Dirty Dozens No. 2,” which was not nearly as successful and the pianist was without a contract or label and again playing making the rounds at Memphis venues and in St. Louis bars. His 1938 session work in Aurora, Illinois, with the slide guitar player Robert Nighthawk and the mandolinist Willie Hatcher for Bluebird Records, was steady and long but also unsuccessful, and sometime in the 1940s he moved back to St. Louis and continued his career of playing in taverns. He also worked as a laborer in a public produce market until servicemen returned home to heavy lifting jobs.Charlie O\\'Brien, a St. Louis policeman and something of a blues aficionado who applied many of his professional investigative methods to track down old bluesmen during the 1950s, \"rediscovered\" Speckled Red on December 14, 1954, who subsequently was signed to Delmark Records as the label\\'s first blues artist. He experienced a small revival of interest in his music during the late 1950s and 1960s, his abilities still considerable, and worked around the St. Louis-area jazz scene, regularly as the intermission pianist for the Dixie Stompers, performing concerts with Dixie Mantinee and the St. Louis Jazz Club, played the Goldenrod Showboat, and played the University of Chicago Folk Festival in 1961, went to Dayton, Ohio, with Gene Mayl\\'s Dixieland Rhythm Kings, and toured Europe in 1959 with Chris Barber. Several recordings were made in 1956 and 1957 for the Tone, Delmark, Folkways, and Storyville record labels.His age, however, had become a factor, and the remainder of the 1960s saw scattered performances. He died of cancer on January 2, 1973, in St. Louis, at the age of 80.[7]', 'StephanieTrick': 'Stephanie Trick (born 1987 in St. Louis, Missouri) is an American stride, ragtime and jazz pianist.Trick began playing piano at the age of five.[2] Her interest outside of classical music began at the age of ten, when her piano teacher introduced her to ragtime.[3] She received her BA degree in music with honors from the University of Chicago in 2009.[2] Trick demonstrates piano performance and composition styles of stride, ragtime and jazz piano from the 1900s to the 1940s.[4] She emphasizes jazz standards, stride and boogie-woogie tunes with an accent on her specialty of Harlem stride.[5] [6] Trick and her husband, pianist Paolo Alderighi, reside in both St. Louis and Milan, Italy, his home town.', 'TRexband': 'T. Rex were an English rock band, formed in 1967 by singer-songwriter and guitarist Marc Bolan. The band was initially called Tyrannosaurus Rex, and released four psychedelic folk albums under this name. In 1969, Bolan began to shift from the band\\'s early acoustic sound to an electric one. The following year, he shortened their name to T. Rex. The 1970 release of the single \"Ride a White Swan\" marked the culmination of this development, and the group soon became a commercial success as part of the emerging glam rock scene.From 1970 until 1973, T. Rex encountered a popularity in the UK comparable to that of the Beatles, with a run of eleven singles in the UK top ten. One of the most prominent acts in British popular culture, they scored four UK number one hits, \"Hot Love\", \"Get It On\", \"Telegram Sam\" and \"Metal Guru\". The band\\'s 1971 album Electric Warrior received critical acclaim as a pioneering glam rock album. It reached number 1 in the UK. The 1972 follow-up, The Slider, entered the top 20 in the US. Following the release of \"20th Century Boy\" in 1973, which reached number three in the UK, T. Rex began to experience less commercial success but continued recording one album per year.In 1977, Bolan died in a car accident several months after releasing their final studio album Dandy in the Underworld. Since then, T. Rex have continued to exert a vast influence on a variety of subsequent artists.Marc Bolan founded Tyrannosaurus Rex in August 1967, following a handful of failed solo singles and a brief career as lead guitarist in psych-rock band John\\'s Children. After a disastrous solitary performance as a four-piece at the Electric Garden in London\\'s Covent Garden, the group immediately broke up. Subsequently, Bolan retained the services of percussionist Steve Peregrin Took and began performing acoustic material as a duo with a repertoire of folk-influenced Bolan-penned songs with an eastern flavour, an obvious homage to Indian musician Ravi Shankar. The combination of Bolan\\'s acoustic guitar and distinctive vocal style with Took\\'s bongos and assorted percussion—which often included children\\'s instruments such as the Pixiphone—earned them a devoted following in the thriving hippy underground scene. BBC Radio One Disc jockey John Peel championed the band early in their recording career.[2] Peel later appeared on record with them, reading stories written by Bolan. Another key collaborator was producer Tony Visconti, who went on to produce the band\\'s albums well into their second, glam rock phase.[3]During 1968–1969, Tyrannosaurus Rex had become a modest success on radio and on record, and they released three albums, the third of which, Unicorn, came within striking distance of the UK Top 10 Albums. While Bolan\\'s early solo material was rock and roll-influenced pop music, by now he was writing dramatic and baroque songs with lush melodies and surreal lyrics filled with Greek and Persian mythology as well as poetic creations of his own. The band became regulars on Peel Sessions on BBC radio, and toured Britain\\'s student union halls.[4]By 1969 there was a rift developing between the two halves of Tyrannosaurus Rex. Bolan and his girlfriend June Child were living a quiet life, Bolan working on his book of poetry entitled The Warlock Of Love and concentrating on his songs and performance skills. Took, however, had fully embraced the anti-commercial, drug-taking ethos of the UK Underground scene centred around Ladbroke Grove. Took was also attracted to anarchistic elements such as Mick Farren/Deviants and members of the Pink Fairies Rock \\'n\\' Roll and Drinking Club.[5] Took also began writing his own songs, and wanted the duo to perform them, but Bolan strongly disapproved of his bandmate\\'s efforts, rejecting them for the duo\\'s putative fourth album, in production in Spring/Summer 1969. In response to Bolan\\'s rebuff, Took contributed two songs as well as vocals and percussion to Twink\\'s Think Pink album.[6]Bolan\\'s relationship with Took ended after this, although they were contractually obliged to go through with a US tour which was doomed before it began. Poorly promoted and planned, the acoustic duo were overshadowed by the loud electric acts they were billed with. To counter this, Took drew from the shock rock style of Iggy Pop; Took explained, \"I took my shirt off in the Sunset Strip where we were playing and whipped myself till everybody shut up. With a belt, y\\'know, a bit of blood and the whole of Los Angeles shuts up. \\'What\\'s going on, man, there\\'s some nutter attacking himself on stage.\\' I mean, Iggy Stooge had the same basic approach.\"[5]As soon as he returned to the UK, Bolan replaced Took with percussionist Mickey Finn.[3] and they completed the fourth album, released in early 1970 as A Beard of Stars, the final album under the Tyrannosaurus Rex moniker. Meanwhile, after helping found the Pink Fairies and appearing on Mick Farren\\'s solo album Mona – The Carnivorous Circus, Took would spend the 1970s working mostly on his own material, either solo or fronting bands such as Shagrat (1970–1971) and Steve Took\\'s Horns (1977–1978).[7] Unlike Took, Finn had no songwriting aspirations; Tony Visconti commented he was not as talented as Took: \"Mickey wasn\\'t as inventive as Steve. Mickey\\'s backing vocals weren\\'t strong, so Marc would double-track them with his own voice for reinforcement\".[8]As well as progressively shorter titles, Tyrannosaurus Rex\\'s albums began to show higher production values, more accessible songwriting from Bolan, and experimentation with electric guitars and a true rock sound.[9] A breakthrough had been \"King of the Rumbling Spires\" (recorded with Took and released in summer 1969 shortly prior to his departure), which used a full rock band setup, and the electric sound had been further explored on A Beard of Stars. The group\\'s next album, T. Rex, continued the process of simplification by shortening the name, and completed the move to electric guitars.[9] Visconti supposedly got fed up with writing the name out in full on studio chits and tapes and began to abbreviate it; when Bolan first noticed he was angry but later claimed the idea was his. The new sound was more pop-oriented, and the first single, \"Ride a White Swan\" released in October 1970 made the Top 10 in the UK by late November and reached number two in January 1971. In early 1971, T. Rex reached the top 20 of the UK Albums Chart.\"Ride a White Swan\" was quickly followed by a second single, \"Hot Love\", which reached the top spot on the UK charts, and remained there for six weeks. A full band, which featured bassist Steve Currie and drummer Bill Legend, was formed to tour to growing audiences, as teenagers began replacing the hippies of old.[3] After Chelita Secunda added two spots of glitter under Bolan\\'s eyes before an appearance on Top of the Pops, the ensuing performance would often be viewed as the birth of glam rock. After Bolan\\'s display, glam rock would gain popularity in the UK and Europe during 1971–72. T. Rex\\'s move to electric guitars coincided with Bolan\\'s more overtly sexual lyrical style and image. The group\\'s new image and sound outraged some of Bolan\\'s older hippie fans, who branded him a \"sell-out\". Some of the lyrical content of Tyrannosaurus Rex remained, but the fairy tales about wizards and magic were now interspersed with sensuous grooves, replete with orgiastic moans and innuendo.In September 1971, T. Rex released their second album Electric Warrior, which featured Currie and Legend. Often considered to be their best album, the chart-topping Electric Warrior brought much commercial success to the group; publicist BP Fallon coined the term \"T. Rextasy\" as a parallel to Beatlemania to describe the group\\'s popularity. The album included T. Rex\\'s best-known song, \"Get It On\", which hit number one in the UK. In January 1972 it became a top ten hit in the US, where the song was retitled \"Bang a Gong (Get It On)\" to distinguish it from a 1971 song by the group Chase. Along with several Sweet hits, \"Get It On\" was among the few British glam rock songs that were successful in the US.[10] However, the album still recalled Bolan\\'s acoustic roots with ballads such as \"Cosmic Dancer\" and the stark \"Girl\". Soon after, Bolan left Fly Records; after his contract had lapsed, the label released the album track \"Jeepster\" as a single without his permission. Bolan went to EMI, where he was given his own record label in the UK—T. Rex Records, the \"T. Rex Wax Co.\".On 18 March 1972, T. Rex played two shows at the Empire Pool, Wembley, which were filmed by Ringo Starr and his crew for Apple Films. A large part of the second show was included on Bolan\\'s own rock film Born to Boogie, while bits and pieces of the first show can be seen throughout the film\\'s end-credits. Along with T. Rex and Starr, Born to Boogie also features Elton John, who jammed with the friends to create rocking studio versions of \"Children of the Revolution\" and \"Tutti Frutti\"; Elton John had appeared on TV with Bolan before, miming the piano part of \"Get it On\" on the 1971 Christmas edition of Top of the Pops.T. Rex\\'s third album The Slider was released in July 1972. The band\\'s most successful album in the US, The Slider was not as successful as its predecessor in the UK, where it peaked at the fourth spot. During spring/summer 1972, Bolan\\'s old label Fly released the chart-topping compilation album Bolan Boogie, a collection of singles, B-sides and LP tracks, which affected The Slider\\'s sales. Two singles from The Slider, \"Telegram Sam\" and \"Metal Guru\", became number one hits in the UK. Born to Boogie premiered at the Oscar One cinema in London, in December 1972. The film received negative reviews from critics, while it was loved by fans.Tanx would mark the end of the classic T. Rex line-up. An eclectic album containing several melancholy ballads and rich production, Tanx showcased the T. Rex sound bolstered by extra instrumental embellishments such as Mellotron and saxophone. \"The Street and Babe Shadow\" was funkier while the last song \"Left Hand Luke and the Beggar Boys\" was seen by critics as a nod to gospel with several female backing singers.[11] Released two months later in March 1973, \"20th Century Boy\" was another important success, peaking at number 3 in the UK Singles chart but was not included in the album.[12] It marked the end of the golden era in which T. Rex scored 11 singles in a row in the UK top ten.During the recording T. Rex members began to quit, starting with Bill Legend in November. Zinc Alloy and the Hidden Riders of Tomorrow was released on 1 February 1974, and reached number 12 in the UK. The album harkened back to the Tyrannosaurus Rex days with long song-titles and lyrical complexity, but was not a critical success. T. Rex by now had an extended line-up which included second guitarist Jack Green and BJ Cole on pedal steel. Soon after the album\\'s release, Bolan split with producer Tony Visconti, then in December 1974, Mickey Finn also left the band. A single, \"Zip Gun Boogie\", appeared in late 1974 credited as a Marc Bolan solo effort (though still on the T. Rex label). It flopped, however, only reaching UK #41, and the T. Rex band identity was quickly re-established.The T. Rex album Bolan\\'s Zip Gun (1975) was self-produced by Bolan who, in addition to writing the songs, gave his music a harder, more futuristic sheen. The final song recorded with Visconti, \"Till Dawn\", was re-recorded for Bolan\\'s Zip Gun with Bolan at the controls. Bolan\\'s own productions were not well received in the music press. An amalgam of Zinc Alloy and Zip Gun was released in the US as Light of Love. Rolling Stone magazine gave it one star out of five, while the British press slammed T. Rex for copying Bowie\\'s The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars, even though Marc had spoken of releasing work under the pseudonym \"Zinc Alloy\" during the mid-1960s. Always a fantasist with an alleged Napoleon complex, during this time Bolan became increasingly isolated, while high tax rates in the UK drove him into exile in Monte Carlo and the US. No longer a vegetarian, Bolan put on weight due to consumption of hamburgers and alcohol, and was ridiculed in the music press.T. Rex\\'s penultimate album, Futuristic Dragon (1976), featured a schizophrenic production style that veered from wall of sound-style songs to nostalgic nods to the old T. Rex boogie machine. It only managed to reach number 50, but the album was better received by the critics and featured the singles \"New York City\" (number 15 in the UK) and \"Dreamy Lady\" (number 30). To promote the album, T. Rex toured the UK, and performed on television shows such as Top of the Pops, Supersonic and Get It Together.In the summer of 1976, T. Rex released two more singles, \"I Love to Boogie\" (which charted at number 13) and \"Laser Love\", which made number 42. In early 1977 Dandy in the Underworld was released to critical acclaim. Bolan had slimmed down and regained his elfin looks, and the songs too had a stripped-down, streamlined sound. A spring UK tour with punk band The Damned on support garnered positive reviews. As Bolan was enjoying a new surge in popularity, he talked about performing again with Finn and Took, as well as reuniting with producer Tony Visconti.Marc Bolan and his girlfriend Gloria Jones spent the evening of 15 September 1977 drinking at the Speakeasy and then dining at Morton\\'s club on Berkeley Square, in Mayfair, Central London. While driving home early in the morning of 16 September, Jones crashed Bolan\\'s purple Mini 1275GT into a tree (now the site of Bolan\\'s Rock Shrine), after failing to negotiate a small humpback bridge near Gipsy Lane on Queens Ride, Barnes, southwest London, a few miles from his home at 142 Upper Richmond Road West in East Sheen. While Jones was severely injured, Bolan was killed in the crash, two weeks before his 30th birthday.[13]Bolan\\'s death ended the band. Steve Peregrin Took died from asphyxiation from a cocktail cherry after his throat was numbed from his use of morphine and magic mushrooms in 1980,[14] Steve Currie also died in a car crash, in 1981;[15] Mickey Finn succumbed to illness in 2003.[16] Peter \\'Dino\\' Dines died of a heart attack in 2004.Since Bolan\\'s death there have been two attempts to reform the band with former members. Since Bolan was the only member to have appeared in every T. Rex lineup as well serving as the band\\'s lead guitarist, lead singer and main songwriter these groups are generally regarded[by whom?] as tribute bands.[citation needed]In 1997 former bongo player Mickey Finn formed Mickey Finn\\'s T-Rex which also included former T. Rex guitarist Jack Green and drummer Paul Fenton who recorded and toured with the band briefly. This band has also included former Smokie guitarist Alan Silson and Saxon guitarist Graham Oliver. Following Finn\\'s death in 2003 the band continued on as T. Rex (A Celebration of Marc and Mickey) until a petition signed by Bill Legend, Tony Visconti and David Bowie, among others, forced them to revert their name back to Mickey Finn\\'s T-Rex with his family\\'s blessing.[17]In 2014 original drummer Bill Legend put together his own version of T. Rex, which was initially known as Bill Legend\\'s T. Rex but is now known as X-T. Rex and has also been billed as T. Rex with Bill Legend and T. Rex with Bill Legend feat. Danny McCoy. This band has toured Europe and was expected to record a new album. Legend is the last surviving member of T. Rex\\'s best known lineup and indeed of any lineup of T.Rex or Tyrannosaurus Rex prior to its mid 1973 commercial decline.[18]T. Rex vastly influenced the glam rock, punk rock, post-punk and Britpop genres. Johnny Marr of The Smiths stated: \"The influence of T. Rex is very profound on certain songs of the Smiths like \"Panic\" and \"Shoplifters of the World Unite\". Lead singer Morrissey also admired Bolan. While writing \"Panic\" he was inspired by \"Metal Guru\" and wanted to sing in the same style. He didn\\'t stop singing it in an attempt to modify the words of \"Panic\" to fit the exact rhythm of \"Metal Guru\". Marr later stated: \"He also exhorted me to use the same guitar break so that the two songs are the same!\"[19] Marr rated Bolan in his ten favourite guitarists.[20][21] Siouxsie and the Banshees released a cover version of \"20th Century Boy\" early in their career in 1979.T. Rex are specifically referenced by The Who in the lyrics of their 1981 hit song \"You Better You Bet\", David Bowie in the song \"All the Young Dudes\" (which he wrote for Mott the Hoople), B A Robertson in his 1980 hit \"Kool in the Kaftan\", the Ramones in their song \"Do You Remember Rock \\'n\\' Roll Radio?\" and R.E.M. in their song \"The Wake-Up Bomb.\" The early acoustic material was influential in helping to bring about progressive rock and 21st century folk music-influenced singers as Devendra Banhart.[22][23] The lyric \"Glimmers like Bolan in the shining sun\" is featured in My Chemical Romance\\'s song \"Vampire Money\", a direct reference to Bolan, taken from their most recent studio album Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys. Additionally, Oasis \"borrowed\" the distinct guitar riff from \"Get It On\" on their single \"Cigarettes & Alcohol\".[24] Oasis\\'s guitarist, Noel Gallagher, has cited T. Rex as a strong influence.[25] The music of T. Rex features in the soundtracks of various movies, including Velvet Goldmine, Death Proof, Billy Elliot and Dallas Buyers Club. The cover of The Slider album can be seen in the Lindsay Anderson movie O Lucky Man! and in Tim Burton\\'s version of Dark Shadows starring Johnny Depp. In Miha Mazzini\\'s novel King of the Rattling Spirits the narrator starts remembering his childhood when he sees T. Rex record \"King of Rumbling Spires\" in the record store and realizes he has mistakenly remembered the title as \"King of the Rattling Spirits\". \"20th Century Boy\" is currently used as the opening theme to the American reality competition series Lip Sync Battle.', 'TutsWashington': 'Isidore \"Tuts\" Washington (January 24, 1907 – August 5, 1984)[1] was an American Louisiana blues pianist,[2] who exemplified New Orleans rhythm and blues, a style also made famous by musicians such as Professor Longhair and Huey \"Piano\" Smith.[1]Washington was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, He taught himself to play the piano at age 10 and studied with the New Orleans jazz pianist Joseph Louis \"Red\" Cayou.[3] In the 1920s and 1930s, he was a leading player for dance bands and Dixieland bands in New Orleans. His unique style of play blended elements of ragtime, jazz, blues, and boogie-woogie.[1]After World War II, Washington joined the singer and guitarist Smiley Lewis in a trio with the drummer Herman Seals;[3] they released several well-known songs for Imperial Records, including \"Tee-Nah-Nah,\" \"The Bells Are Ringing\" and \"Dirty People.\" Washington then moved to St. Louis to play with Tab Smith.[1] He returned to New Orleans in the 1960s, performing in restaurants in the French Quarter, in clubs such as Tipitina\\'s, and at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival. For years he had a regular engagement playing piano at a bar in the Pontchartrain Hotel. He avoided recording for most of his career,[3] but he released the solo piano album New Orleans Piano Professor for Rounder Records in 1983.[1]Washington died on August 5, 1984, after having a heart attack while performing at the World\\'s Fair in New Orleans.[1]A live recording by Washington, Live at Tipitina\\'s \\'78, was released by Night Train International Records in 1998.', 'UlfSandstrC3B6mpianist': 'Ulf Gustaf Sandström (born 18 August 1964) is the foremost representative in Sweden of piano playing and composing in the traditions of boogie-woogie, with a lot of New Orleans flavour. He was born in Colombia to Swedish parents, and has subsequently traveled and lived in a large number of countries. He was taught piano at four in Hungary by the methods of Zoltán Kodály, which focus on learning by ear. His main influence and mentor in music is Clarence \"Frogman\" Henry from New Orleans. Notably, his live performances are often riddled with surrealistic verbality on the verge of stand-up comedy. His main group is a constantly touring quartet (jump4joy), with over 4000 concerts internationally since 1992. The group has toured since 1992, backing artists like \"Frogman\" Henry, Albert King, The Drifters, Tommy Ridgley and James Wheeler. Six albums have been released on Last Buzz Records.', 'VinceWeber': 'Vince Weber (born October 26, 1953, Hamburg) is a German blues and boogie-woogie pianist.Weber started taking piano lessons aged ten, in 1963. His sister introduced him to the blues by giving him records of Lightnin\\' Hopkins, Champion Jack Dupree, Taj Mahal and many others. At the age of sixteen he played in bars in the harbour of his hometown Hamburg, where he met Hans-Georg Möller, another pianist, who introduced him to the boogie-woogie style of playing piano. There he also met the comedian Otto Waalkes, who booked him as opener for his then-current tour. In 1975 he released his first album, The Boogie Man on Otto Waalkes\\' Rüssel Räckords, which was awarded \\'Deutscher Schallplattenpreis 1976\\'. This album was partly recorded in the \\'Fabrik\\', where he has had a regular gig once a month since 1976. In 1978 he traveled to the United States for the first time.

Possible dates include December 20, 1902 (according to his Social Security documentation),[4] or December 4, 1903 (according to his death certificate),[1] though the researchers Bob Eagle and Eric LeBlanc suggest 1900 on the basis of 1910 census information.[5]He started playing on the Birmingham blues circuit in the 1920s. A competent and versatile pianist, his range covered slow blues to upbeat, jaunty boogie-woogie numbers. He was also skilled as a guitar player and had a forceful singing voice.[2] Between 1933 and 1935, Roland traveled to New York on three occasions, recording around fifty songs under his own name for Banner Records (ARC).[3] In 1933, he recorded \"Red Cross Store Blues\" (variously \"Red Cross Blues\"), his cynical viewpoint on welfare benefits.[6][7] Amongst his other better-known efforts are \"No Good Biddie\", \"Jookit Jookit\", \"Piano Stomp\", \"Whatcha Gonna Do\", and \"Early This Morning\".[8]In addition to his solo output, Roland also recorded as an accompanist for other musicians. For example, the guitarist and singer Sonny Scott recorded fourteen tracks for Vocalion in 1933, all of them backed by Roland.[9] The tracks included two instrumentals (\"Guitar Stomp\" and \"Railroad Stomp\"), billed on record as the Jolly Two, in which Roland matched Scott\\'s guitar work.[8]Lucille Bogan was usually accompanied by Roland on piano, although he sometimes played an acoustic guitar backing.[10] She was also in New York in 1933, and, apparently to conceal her identity, began recording as Bessie Jackson for Banner Records. She recorded over 100 songs between 1933 and 1935, including some of her biggest commercial successes such as \"Seaboard Blues\", \"Troubled Mind\", and \"Superstitious Blues\".During this same period Roland also accompanied Josh White on several tracks.[2]Bogan\\'s final recordings with Roland and White included two takes of \"Shave \\'Em Dry\", recorded in New York on Tuesday, March 5, 1935. The unexpurgated alternate take is notorious for its explicit sexual references, a unique record of the lyrics sung in after-hours clubs.[11][12]Roland did not record beyond this point and, by 1950, had become a farmer, then known by the nicknames Old Soul and Shave \\'Em Dry. In the 1960s, he performed as a street musician for several years. He lost his sight after intervening in a neighbor\\'s argument, when he was inadvertently hit by buckshot. In the late 1960s he retired to Fairfield, Alabama, and was cared for by his daughters, having earlier being widowed.[1]He died of lung cancer on October 12, 1972, in Fairfield.[1]Apart from the musicians mentioned above, several notables recorded versions of Roland\\'s songs, including Sonny Boy Williamson II, Big Joe Williams, Booker T. Laury, Kim Simmonds, Koerner, Ray & Glover, Fred McDowell, and Lead Belly.[13]His track \"Every Morning Blues\" (recorded August 2, 1934, in New York), appeared on the 1992 compilation album, Roots \\'n Blues: The Retrospective 1925–1950. In 1994, Document Records released a twin set of all of Roland\\'s solo recordings.[14]', 'WayneFederman': 'Wayne Federman (born June 22, 1959) is an American comedian, actor, author, comedy writer, and musician. He is noted for numerous stand-up comedy appearances in clubs, theaters, and on television; a biography of \"Pistol\" Pete Maravich; and supporting comedic acting roles in The X-Files, The Larry Sanders Show, Curb Your Enthusiasm, Community, Legally Blonde, 50 First Dates, The 40-Year-Old Virgin, and Step Brothers. He was the head monologue writer for NBC\\'s Late Night with Jimmy Fallon in its first season.Federman was born in Los Angeles, one of six children. He grew up in Silver Spring, Maryland, and moved to Plantation, Florida at age 10. He played the drums and at age 14 began performing in a band at local weddings. He taught himself ventriloquism and performed at various school (South Plantation High School) functions as well as local churches and service organizations. He delivered his high school\\'s sports results on Miami radio station WWOK. He made his local television debut on WPLG\\'s Youth and the Issue debating the death penalty. In 1976, Federman worked as an extra in John Frankenheimer\\'s Black Sunday, shot at the Miami Orange Bowl.In the fall of 1977, Federman was accepted into the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University. There he studied with legendary acting coach Stella Adler. He performed his own show, Comedy Tonight, at the Eisner and Lubin Auditorium, with future Broadway star Donna Murphy.After college Federman brought his one-man show to the 13th Street Theater. There he performed in rotation with Brother Theodore. He also starred in the theater\\'s production of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, in which he played six roles. Soon he was performing stand-up comedy at various New York Comedy Clubs, most notably The Comic Strip (now known as Comic Strip Live) and Catch a Rising Star. It was during these years that he incorporated music into his act. He closed his sets by playing hard rock tunes from Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, Iron Butterfly, and The Rolling Stones on his electric ukulele.Federman made his national television debut on the syndicated stand-up program Comedy Tonight in 1986. He also appeared in two home videos: New Wave Comedy and the Dodge Comedy Showcase.In 1987, Federman moved to Los Angeles and began working at The Improv, IGBYs, The Laugh Factory, and The Comedy & Magic Club.

Law (3 episodes) and Living Single (3 episodes).In 1992, Federman made his debut on The Tonight Show and has subsequently appeared many times on the program. He also appeared on Late Fridays, Comedy Showcase, and Premium Blend. In 2004, he taped his own 1/2-hour stand-up special for the series, Comedy Central Presents.In 1998, Wayne appeared as Larry Sander\\'s brother Stan, and was later reunited with Garry Shandling on The X-Files episode \"Hollywood A.D.\". Written and directed by David Duchovny, the creative episode followed \"Wayne Federman\", a Hollywood producer/writer and college friend of assistant FBI director Walter Skinner.Television led Wayne to film roles in Jack Frost, Dill Scallion, Legally Blonde, 50 First Dates, Charlie\\'s Angels: Full Throttle, The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Unaccompanied Minors, Knocked Up, Step Brothers, and Funny People.In 2006, Federman landed the recurring role of \"Johnson\" on the short-lived CBS sitcom Courting Alex. He co-wrote and starred in Max and Josh, a short film that premiered at the 2006 Sundance Film Festival, where it won the Volkswagen Relentless Drive Award.[1]Beginning in 2007, Federman wrote, produced, and hosted an annual holiday variety show entitled A Very Federman Christmas at the Los Angeles nightclub Largo. Guests included Paul F. Tompkins, Kevin Nealon, Jon Hamm, Dana Gould, Sarah Silverman, Mary Lynn Rajskub, Samm Levine, Margaret Cho, Greg Behrendt, Willie Garson, Paul Williams, Matt Besser, John C. Reilly, and Andrew Daly.In 1990, while shooting a television commercial campaign for McDonald\\'s (directed by Henry Winkler), Federman recorded a series of tie-in radio commercials. This launched his voice-over career. Since then his distinctive voice has been heard on hundreds of radio and television spots. He was the voice of the talking ham and cheese sandwich in the long-running Florida Orange Juice campaign.He also provided voices for the animated series The Wild Thornberrys, King of the Hill, and American Dad!, as well as the voice of Cartoon Cartoon Friday on the Cartoon Network.In 2007, Federman voiced a series of Labatt Beer commercials, portraying a fish, a deer, a boulder, and slab of ice.

He was the show\\'s head monologue writer in its first season, and left in January 2010.On April 20, 2010, Federman unearthed a long-lost live episode of the General Electric Theater while working on a television retrospective for the Reagan Centennial Celebration. The episode, from December 1954, was noteworthy because it teamed Ronald Reagan with James Dean. Highlights were broadcast on the CBS Evening News, NBC Nightly News, and Good Morning America.In July 2010, Federman was part of the last comedians to tour and perform for U.S. combat troops throughout Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom.One of Federman\\'s stand-up jokes about Woody Allen (\"I’ve come to really admire Woody Allen. It’s been 14 years, and he’s still married to the same daughter.\") was voted the No. 4 joke of the year in 2010 by a survey in The New York Post.In June 2011, Federman headlined the Ukulele Festival of Great Britain along with James Hill.In November 2011, an article Federman wrote about Ronald Reagan\\'s pivotal role in establishing residual payments for film actors was published in The Atlantic.January 2012 saw the launch of the annual Wayne Federman International Film Festival, featuring comedians screening the movies they love. Participants included Paul F. Tompkins, Garry Shandling, Andy Kindler, Kevin Pollak, Margaret Cho, Doug Benson, Zach Galifianakis, Bill Burr, Will Forte, Sacha Baron Cohen, Chris Hardwick, Lauren Lapkus, Kathy Griffin, Dana Gould, Patton Oswalt, Tig Notaro, Aziz Ansari, Jeff Garlin, and Sarah Silverman.In 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015, Federman co-wrote the Independent Spirit Awards, hosted by Seth Rogen, Andy Samberg, Patton Oswalt, and the team of Fred Armisen and Kristen Bell respectively. Federman received three Writers Guild of America Award nominations and one Emmy Award nomination for his work.Federman has guested on over fifty podcasts, including Comedy Bang! Bang!, The Nerdist Podcast, Never Not Funny, Doug Loves Movies, You Made It Weird, The Adam Corolla Show, FitzDog Radio, Improv4Humans, Kevin Pollak Chat Show, Sklarbro Country and The Joe Rogan Experience.Beginning in March 2015, Federman co-hosts the podcast Human Conversation with comedian Erin McGathy, in which the two discuss various, oft-delightful and meandering topics, without the aid of technology.', 'WilliamEzell': 'William Ezell (December 23, 1892 – August 2, 1963),[1][2] was an American blues, jazz, ragtime and boogie-woogie pianist and occasional singer, who was also billed as Will Ezell. He regularly contributed to recordings made by Paramount Records in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Ezell was noted by the music journalist Bruce Eder as \"a technically brilliant pianist, showing the strong influence of jazz as well as blues in his work\".[3]Ezell\\'s \"Pitchin\\' Boogie\" and Cow Cow Davenport\\'s \"Cow Cow Blues\" were amongst the earliest boogie-woogie recordings. However, Pinetop Smith\\'s \"Pinetop\\'s Boogie-Woogie\" was the first to use the phrase in the title of a song.[4]Two of Ezell\\'s more notable solo recordings, \"Heifer Dust\" and \"Barrel House Woman\" (both 1929), have been noted for containing \"elements of both blues and barrelhouse boogie-woogie in their form\".[5]Ezell was born in Brenham, Texas, United States,[1][note 1] one of six children to Lorenza Ezell, a farm laborer, and his wife Rachel. According to the 1900 United States Census, the family were still living in Brenham. The same source showed that Ezell\\'s mother had died at some point between 1901 and 1910. Ezell found loose employment as a barrelhouse pianist and, by 1917, had relocated to New Orleans, Louisiana, according to his draft record, and was working as a self-employed musician. There is no evidence that Ezell was conscripted at any time. He continued his itinerant work, finding employment at riverside sawmill camps in Louisiana and East Texas.[2][4]By the early 1920s, Ezell was working with the blues singer Elzadie Robinson. Around 1925, Ezell moved to Chicago, Illinois, and made friends with Blind Blake and Charlie Spand.[2] Ezell, along with others such as Spand,[6] was one of the boogie-woogie pianists who, in the 1920s, performed on Brady Street and Hastings Street in Detroit, Michigan.[5] By 1926, Ezell started work for Paramount in Chicago, as they provided regular work for black musicians, which was not always available elsewhere.[2] There is some doubt as to his first recording, but he wrote \"Sawmill Blues\", which was recorded by Elzadie Robinson (under the pseudonym of Bernice Drake) in October that year.[7] His flexibility in playing differing styles proved popular, and one of his earliest duties was accompanying Lucille Bogan on \"Sweet Petunia\", a song full of Bogan\\'s trademark double entendres.[2] There is evidence that Ezell and Bogan\\'s relationship went beyond the recording studio, to the extent that Bogan\\'s husband considered divorce proceedings.[2][4]During 1927, Ezell\\'s status at Paramount grew, and he operated under the stewardship of Aletha Dickerson, who had replaced J. Mayo Williams as the head of Paramount\\'s Chicago operations. As well as being an accompanist, arranger, and part-producer for other musicians, Ezell recorded his own material for the label between 1928 and 1929. These tracks included his two best-known recordings, \"Mixed Up Rag\" and \"Heifer Dust\".[2] Ezell\\'s playing style was similar to that of Jimmy Blythe.[3] However, he was a popular musician who was warmly recalled by Little Brother Montgomery, who had a similar route to notability. Over his time with Paramount, Ezell\\'s own recordings and his association with Charlie Spand, Baby James and Blind Roosevelt Graves, were amongst the highest quality ever issued by that label, which earlier had a reputation for substandard recordings.[2]In addition to his musical input, Ezell\\'s duties with Paramount were far reaching.[2] In December 1929, he escorted the body of Blind Lemon Jefferson, who had been one of the label\\'s best selling artists, by railroad back to Jefferson\\'s homeland of Texas for burial.[3] His musical input at Paramount ceased in early 1930, except for his accompaniment of Slim Tarpley on two sides in 1931. Paramount Records was rapidly declining as the effects of the Great Depression began to be felt, and later that year Ezell was back to playing in Louisiana, accompanying Clarence Hall. Ezell\\'s whereabouts in the later 1930s are largely unknown,[4] but the researcher John Steiner noted that Cripple Clarence Lofton, who owned a club in Chicago, hosted on stage Ezell, Spand, Leroy Garnett and others through the end of World War II. Records indicate that Ezell continued to be based in Chicago during this time. He worked at their Crane Technical School, operated as part of the New Deal laws, although whether he was employed as an instructor or a maintenance worker is not certain.[2]Ezell died in Chicago in 1963 in Chicago, at the age of 70.[4] His death was not reported in any newspaper obituaries.[2]In 1992, Document Records issued a compilation album containing 23 tracks he recorded during his time with Paramount, from February 1927 to January 1931.[8][8]', 'WillieHallpianist': 'Willie Hall (died 1930),[1] best known by his nickname Drive \\'Em Down, was a New Orleans blues and boogie woogie piano player. He never recorded, but has had a great influence on blues and rock and roll.[citation needed]According to Champion Jack Dupree, who called Drive \\'Em Down his \"father\" and cited him as \"teaching me his style\", Hall played in barrelhouses. His earthy song, \"Junker\\'s Blues\", with its stories about needles and reefer and the Angola prison farm was recorded by Dupree in 1940.[2] In 1949 Fats Domino reworked the song as \"The Fat Man\",[3] the first of his 35 Top 40 hits. The melody was used by Professor Longhair for \"Tipitina\" and by Lloyd Price for \"Lawdy Miss Clawdy.\" Willy DeVille recorded the song in 1990 on his Victory Mixture album. The song also directly inspired the song \"Junco Partner\",[4] first recorded in 1951 by James Waynes and later also widely covered by other musicians.', 'WinifredAtwell': 'Una Winifred Atwell (27 February or 27 April 1910 or 1914[nb 1] – 28 February 1983) was a Trinidadian pianist who enjoyed great popularity in Britain and Australia from the 1950s with a series of boogie-woogie and ragtime hits, selling over 20 million records.[2] She was the first black person to have a number-one hit in the UK Singles Chart and is still the only female instrumentalist to do so.[3][4]Atwell was born in Tunapuna in Trinidad and Tobago. She and her parents lived in Jubilee Street. Her family owned a pharmacy, and she trained as a pharmacist, and was expected to join the family business. Winifred, however, had played the piano from a young age, and achieved considerable popularity locally. She played for American servicemen at the Air Force base (which is now the main airport). It was while playing at the Servicemen\\'s Club at Piarco that someone bet her she could not play something in the boogie-woogie style that was popular back home in the United States. She went away and wrote \"Piarco Boogie\", which was later renamed \"Five Finger Boogie\".[5][6]Atwell left Trinidad in the early 1940s and travelled to the United States to study with Alexander Borovsky and, in 1946, moved to London, where she had gained a place at the Royal Academy of Music. She became the first female pianist to be awarded the Academy\\'s highest grading for musicianship. To support her studies, she played rags at London clubs and theatres. These modest beginnings in variety would one day see her topping the bill at the London Palladium. She said later, \"I starved in a garret to get onto concert stages\".[citation needed]Atwell attracted attention with an unscheduled appearance at the Casino Theatre, where she substituted for an ill star. She caught the eye of entrepreneur Bernard Delfont, who put her on a long-term contract. She released three discs that were well received. The third, \"Jezebel\", went to the top of the bestseller lists.[which?] It was her fourth disc that catapulted her to huge popularity in the UK. A complex arrangement called \"Cross Hands Boogie\" was released to show her virtuoso rhythmic technique, but it was the B-side, a 1900s tune written by George Botsford called \"Black and White Rag\", that was to become a radio standard.[7] Atwell was championed by popular disc jockey Jack Jackson, who introduced her to Decca promotions manager Hugh Mendl, who launched his career as a staff producer at Decca producing Atwell\\'s recordings.\"Black And White Rag\" started a craze for her honky-tonk style of playing. The rag was originally performed on a concert grand for the occasion, but Atwell felt it did not sound right, and so got her husband to buy a honky tonk piano for 30 shillings, which would then be used for the released version of the song.Atwell\\'s husband, former stage comedian Lew Levisohn, was vital in shaping her career as a variety star. The two had met in 1946, and married soon after. They were inseparable up to Levisohn\\'s death in Hong Kong in December 1977; they had no children. He had cannily made the choice, for stage purposes, of her playing first a concert grand, then a beaten-up old upright piano. The latter was purchased from a Battersea junk shop for 50 shillings. This became famous as \"my other piano\". It would later feature all over the world, from Las Vegas to the Sydney Opera House, travelling over half a million miles by air throughout Atwell\\'s concert career. While contributing to a posthumous BBC radio appreciation of Atwell\\'s career, Richard Stilgoe revealed that he was now the owner of the famous \"other piano\".When Atwell first came to Britain, she initially earned only a few pounds a week. By the mid-1950s, this had shot up to over $10,000. By 1952, her popularity had spread internationally.[8] Her hands were insured with Lloyd\\'s of London for £40,000 (the policy stipulating that she was never to wash dishes).[8] She signed a record contract with Decca, and her sales were soon 30,000 discs a week. She was by far the biggest selling pianist of her time.[6] Her 1954 hit \"Let\\'s Have Another Party\" was the first piano instrumental to reach number one in the UK Singles Chart.[3] She is the only holder of two gold and two silver discs for piano music in Britain, and was the first black artist in the UK to sell a million records.[8] Millions of copies of her sheet music were sold, and she went on to record her best-known hits, including \"Let\\'s Have a Party\", \"Flirtation Waltz\", \"Poor People of Paris\" (which reached number one in the UK Singles Chart in 1956),[9] \"Britannia Rag\" and \"Jubilee Rag\". Her signature \"Black and White Rag\" became famous again in the 1970s as the theme of the BBC snooker programme Pot Black,[2] which also enjoyed great popularity in Australia when screened on the ABC network. It was during this period that she discovered Matt Monro and persuaded Decca to sign him.[10][11]Winifred Atwell\\'s peak was the second half of the 1950s, during which her concerts drew standing room only crowds in Europe and Australasia. She played three Royal Variety Performances, appeared in every capital city in Europe, and played for over twenty million people. At a private party for Queen Elizabeth II, she was called back for an encore by the monarch herself, who requested \"Roll Out the Barrel\". She became a firm television favourite. She had her own series in Britain. The first of these was Bernard Delfont Presents The Winifred Atwell Show. It ran for ten episodes on the new ITV network from 21 April to 23 June 1956, and the BBC picked up the series the following year. On a third triumphal tour of Australia, she recorded her own Australian television series, screened in 1960–1961.[12] Her brilliant career earned her a fortune, and would have extended further to the US but for issues of race. Her breakthrough appearance was to have been on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1956, but on arrival in America she was confronted with problems of selling the show in the south with a British-sounding black woman. The appearance was never recorded.[1]In 1955, Atwell arrived in Australia and was greeted as an international celebrity. Her tour broke box-office records on the Tivoli circuit, bringing in £600,000 in box office receipts. She was paid AUS$5,000 a week (the equivalent of around $50,000 today), making her the highest paid star from a Commonwealth country to visit Australia up to that time.[citation needed]She toured Australia many times and took on Australian guitarist Jimmy Doyle as her musical director in the 1960s. Her popularity in Australia led to her settling in Sydney in the 1970s. She became an Australian citizen two years before her death.[13]Keith Emerson noted her influence on his playing in an interview: \"I\\'ve always been into ragtime. In England—and I\\'m sure Rick Wakeman would concur—we loved Winifred Atwell, a fantastic honky-tonk and ragtime player.\"[14]Atwell was also a skilled interpreter of classical music. On 1 and 2 December 1954, at London\\'s Kingsway Hall, she made one of the first stereo classical recordings in the UK, with the London Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Stanford Robinson, of a major repertoire work, the \"Piano Concerto in A-minor, Op. 16\", by Grieg. The two-channel version (engineered by Decca\\'s Roy Wallace) appears not to have been released, but a transfer of the Decca LP (mono) LF1206 has been produced and issued by Pristine Audio as an available download. Another Decca recording by Atwell is George Gershwin\\'s Rhapsody in Blue with Ted Heath\\'s band, which contained an arrangement in the slow section in the Glenn Miller style.Atwell bought an apartment on the beach front in the Flightdeck at Collaroy in Sydney, as jumping-off bases for her worldwide performance commitments. She was a member of the Moby\\'s Dick Surfer\\'s Club at Whale Beach where she performed regularly in support of the surf club. Enjoying the affection of the public, she was nevertheless keenly aware of prejudice and injustice and was outspoken about racism in Australia. She always donated her services in a charity concert on Sundays, the proceeds going to orphanages and needy children. She spoke out against the third world conditions endured by Australian Aborigines, which made headlines during an outback tour of the country in 1962. Dismissing racism as a factor in her own life, she said she felt she was \"spoiled very much by the public.\" She left her estate to the Australian Guide Dogs for the Blind and a small amount to her goddaughter. However a cousin of Lew Levisohn contested Atwell\\'s will and is reported to have been granted $30,000 from her estate.Atwell also created headlines in the 1960s with her dieting (slimming from sixteen to twelve stone on what would today be called a protein diet).In 1978, she appeared on Australian TV\\'s This Is Your Life and was admired by the younger generation in Australia in the 1970s. She played her \"other\" piano at the end of the show with a few bars from \"Black and White Rag\" after the piano being in retirement for many years.Though a dynamic stage personality, Atwell was, in person, a shy, retiring and soft-spoken woman of modesty. Eloquent and intellectual, she was well read and, unlike many in the world of professional showbusiness, keenly interested in and informed about issues and current events. Voracious in her reading habits and a devotee of crosswords, she confessed to an inordinate love of mangoes, a dislike of new shoes, and a keen interest in televised cricket (she backed England).[15] She was also a devout Catholic, who unpretentiously played the organ for her parish church.Atwell often returned to her native Trinidad, and on one occasion she bought a house in Saint Augustine, a home she adored and later renamed Winvilla and which was later turned into the Pan Pipers Music School by one of her students, Louise McIntosh. In 1968 she had recorded Ivory and Steel, an album of standards and classics, with the Pan Am Jet North Stars Steel Orchestra (director/arranger Anthony Williams), and supported musical scholarships in the West Indies. In the early 1980s, Atwell\\'s sense of loss following her husband\\'s death made her consider returning to Trinidad to live, but she found the weather too hot.Atwell suffered a stroke in 1980. She officially retired on The Mike Walsh Show, then Australia\\'s highest rating television variety programme, in 1981. She categorically stated that she would retire and not return as a public performer, and that she had had an excellent career. Her last TV performance was \"Choo Choo Samba\" followed with a medley of \"Black and White Rag\" and \"Twelfth Street Rag\". Her only non-private performances from this point were as an organist in her parish church at Narrabeen. In 1983, following an electrical fire that destroyed her Narrabeen home, she suffered a heart attack and died while staying with friends in Seaforth. She is buried beside husband Lew Levisohn in South Gundurimba Private Cemetery in northern New South Wales, just outside Lismore.In 1969 she was awarded Trinidad and Tobago\\'s national award the Gold Hummingbird Medal, for her achievements in music.[16]Winifred Atwell at the National Film and Sound ArchiveWinifred Atwell and her other piano: 16 hit singles and a \\'blanket of silence\\', sounding the limits of jazz George McKay (2014) Chapter in Jason Toynbee et al. eds. Black British Jazz (Ashgate)', 'ZZTop': 'ZZ Top /ˈziːziːtɒp/ is a rock band formed in 1969 in Houston, Texas. Current members are bassist and lead vocalist Dusty Hill, guitarist and lead vocalist Billy Gibbons (the band\\'s leader, main lyricist and musical arranger), and drummer Frank Beard. One of just a few major label recording groups with the same lineup for more than 45 years. \"As genuine roots musicians, they have few peers,\" according to former musician, critic and collector Michael \"Cub\" Coda. \"Gibbons is one of America\\'s finest blues guitarists working in the arena rock idiom [...] while Hill and Beard provide the ultimate rhythm section support.\"[1]The band released its first album—called ZZ Top\\'s First Album—in 1971. Beginning with blues-inspired rock, the band incorporated new wave, punk rock and dance-rock by using synthesizers. The band is also known for its humorous lyrics laced with double entendres and innuendo.The band\\'s top-selling album was the 1983 Eliminator, which sold more than 10 million copies in the United States. Total record sales of 25 million place ZZ Top among the top-100-selling artists in the United States, according to the Recording Industry Association of America.[8] That includes 11 gold, seven platinum and three multi-platinum records as of 2016, according to the RIAA. By 2014, ZZ Top had sold more than 50 million albums worldwide.[9]ZZ Top was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004.The original line-up was formed in Houston and consisted of Gibbons, organist Lanier Greig (died February 2013)[10][11] and drummer Dan Mitchell.[citation needed]The name of the band was Gibbons\\' idea. The band had a little apartment covered with concert posters and he noticed that many performers\\' names utilized initials. Gibbons particularly noticed B.B. King and Z.Z. Hill and thought of combining the two into \"ZZ King\", but considered it too similar to the original name. He then figured that \"king is going at the top\" which brought him to \"ZZ Top\".[12]ZZ Top was managed by Bill Ham, a Waxahachie, Texas native who had befriended Gibbons a year earlier. They released their first single, \"Salt Lick\", in 1969, and the B-side contained the song \"Miller\\'s Farm\". Both songs were credited to Gibbons. Immediately after the recording of \"Salt Lick\", Greig was replaced by bassist Billy Ethridge, a band-mate of Stevie Ray Vaughan, and Mitchell was replaced by Frank Beard of the American Blues. Due to lack of interest from U.S. record companies, ZZ Top accepted a record deal from London Records. Unwilling to sign a recording contract, Ethridge quit the band and Dusty Hill was selected as his replacement. After Hill moved from Dallas to Houston, ZZ Top signed with London in 1970. They performed their first concert together at the Knights of Columbus Hall in Beaumont on February 10.In addition to assuming the role as the band\\'s leader, Gibbons became the main lyricist and musical arranger. With the assistance of Ham and engineer Robin Hood Brians, ZZ Top\\'s First Album (1971) was released and exhibited the band\\'s humour, with \"barrelhouse\" rhythms, distorted guitars, double entendres, and innuendo. The music and songs reflected ZZ Top\\'s blues influences. Following their debut album, the band released Rio Grande Mud (1972), which failed commercially and the promotional tour consisted of mostly empty auditoriums.[citation needed]ZZ Top released Tres Hombres in 1973. The album\\'s sound was the result of the propulsive support provided by Hill and Beard, and Gibbons\\' \"growling\" guitar tone. Dan Erlewine wrote that the album \"brought ZZ Top their first Top Ten record, making them stars in the process\". The album included the boogie-driven \"La Grange\" (written about the Chicken Ranch, a notorious brothel in La Grange, Texas, that also inspired the musical The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas). On the subsequent tour, the band performed sold-out concerts in the US. ZZ Top recorded the live tracks for their 1975 album, Fandango!, during this tour. Fandango! was a top-ten album; its single \"Tush\" peaked at No. 20 on the Billboard Hot 100. Tejas, released in 1976, was not as successful or as positively received as their previous efforts, although the album went to no. 17 on the Billboard 200.[13] ZZ Top continued the Worldwide Texas Tour in support of Tejas, though they had been touring for seven years. The band then went on what was supposed to be a 90-day break from public appearances. Gibbons traveled to Europe, Beard went to Jamaica, and Hill went to Mexico.[14] The break extended to two years, during which Gibbons and Hill grew chest-length beards.[15]In 1979, ZZ Top signed with Warner Bros. Records and released the album Degüello. While the album went platinum, it only reached no. 24 on the Billboard chart.[16] The album produced two popular singles: \"I Thank You\", a cover of a song recorded by Sam & Dave, and \"Cheap Sunglasses\". The band remained a popular concert attraction and toured in support of Degüello. In April 1980, ZZ Top made their first appearance in Europe, performing for the German music television show Rockpalast. Their next album, El Loco, was released in October 1981, and featured the singles \"Tube Snake Boogie\", \"Pearl Necklace\", and \"Leila\".[17]ZZ Top\\'s next album was even more successful. Eliminator, released in March 1983, featured two top 40 singles (\"Gimme All Your Lovin\\'\" and \"Legs\"), and two additional Top Rock hits (\"Got Me Under Pressure\" and \"Sharp Dressed Man\"), with \"Legs\" peaking at no. 13 on the Club Play Singles chart.[18] Eliminator was a critical and commercial success, selling more than 10 million copies,[8] and several music videos were in regular rotation on MTV. The band also won their first MTV Video Music Awards in the categories of Best Group Video for \"Legs\", and Best Direction for \"Sharp Dressed Man\". The music videos were included in their Greatest Hits video, which was later released on DVD and quickly went multiple-platinum.[8] However, the Eliminator album was not without controversy. According to former stage manager David Blayney in his book \"Sharp Dressed Men\", sound engineer Linden Hudson co-wrote much of the material on the album while serving as a live-in high-tech music teacher to Beard and Gibbons. Despite continued denials by the band, it settled a five-year legal battle with Hudson, paying him $600,000 after he proved he held the copyright to the song \"Thug\".[19][20][21]Despite not selling as many copies as Eliminator, 1985\\'s Afterburner became the band\\'s highest-charting album,[22] racking up sales of five million units.[8] All of the singles from Afterburner were Top 40 hits, with two (\"Sleeping Bag\" and \"Stages\") hitting no. 1 on the Mainstream Rock chart.[22] The music video for \"Velcro Fly\" was choreographed by pop singer Paula Abdul.[23] ZZ Top\\'s grueling Afterburner World Tour lasted well into 1987, which also saw the release of The ZZ Top Sixpack, a three-disc collection of ZZ Top\\'s albums from 1970 to 1981, with the exception of Degüello. The albums ZZ Top\\'s First Album, Rio Grande Mud, Tres Hombres, Fandango, and Tejas were remixed to have a more contemporary sound.[24]Recycler, released in 1990, was ZZ Top\\'s last studio album under contract with Warner Records. Recycler was also the last of a distinct sonic trilogy in the ZZ Top catalogue, marking a return towards a simpler guitar-driven blues sound with less synthesizer and pop bounce than the previous two albums. This move did not entirely suit the fan base that Eliminator and Afterburner had built up, and while Recycler did achieve platinum status, it never matched the sales of those albums.In 1992, Warner released ZZ Top\\'s Greatest Hits, along with a new Rolling Stones-style cut, \"Gun Love\", and an Elvis-inflected video, \"Viva Las Vegas\". In 1993, ZZ Top inducted a major influence, Cream, into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.In 1994, the band signed a $35 million deal with RCA Records,[25] releasing the million-selling Antenna. Subsequent RCA albums, Rhythmeen (1996) and 1999\\'s XXX (the second album to feature live tracks) sold well, but did not reach the levels enjoyed previously. In 2003, ZZ Top released a final RCA album, Mescalero, an album thick with harsh Gibbons guitar and featuring a hidden track — a cover version of \"As Time Goes By\". RCA impresario Clive Davis wanted to do a collaboration record (in the mode of Carlos Santana\\'s successful Supernatural) for this album. In an interview in Goldmine magazine, Davis stated that artists Pink, Dave Matthews, and Wilco were among the artists slated for the project. ZZ Top performed \"Tush\" and \"Legs\" as part of the Super Bowl XXXI halftime show in 1997.A comprehensive four-CD collection of recordings from the London and Warner Bros. years, Chrome, Smoke & BBQ, was released in 2003. It featured the band\\'s first single (A- and B-side) and several rare B-side tracks, as well as a radio promotion from 1979, a live track, and several extended dance mix versions of their biggest MTV hits. Three tracks from Billy Gibbons\\' pre-ZZ band, The Moving Sidewalks, were also included.In 2004, ZZ Top was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones gave the induction speech. ZZ Top gave a brief performance, playing \"La Grange\" and \"Tush\".Expanded and remastered versions of the original studio albums from the 1970s and \\'80s are currently in production. Marketed as \"Remastered and Expanded\", these releases include additional live tracks which were not present on the original recordings. Three such CDs have been released to date (Tres Hombres, Fandango!, and Eliminator). The first two were released in 2006 and use the original mixes free from echo and drum machines, while Eliminator was released in 2008. The Eliminator re-release also features a collector\\'s edition version containing a DVD featuring several videos and additional live tracks.[26]The Eliminator Collector\\'s Edition CD/DVD, celebrating the 25th anniversary of the band\\'s iconic RIAA Diamond Certified album, was released September 10, 2008. The release includes seven bonus tracks and a bonus DVD, including four television performances from The Tube in November 1983.The band performed at the 2009 Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo on the final night on March 22, 2009. In July, the band appeared on VH1\\'s Storytellers, in celebration of their four decades as recording artists.[27]Billy Gibbons stated in an interview in August 2011 that a new album had been recorded, with initial recording taking place in Malibu, California before moving to Houston, but was still unnamed and had yet to be mixed and mastered.[28] Gibbons said that the expected release date was sometime in March or April 2012, but later on a release in the late summer or early fall was announced.[28] The album was subsequently released on September 11, 2012.[29]Entitled La Futura, the album was produced by Rick Rubin.[30][31] The first single from the album, \"I Gotsta Get Paid\", debuted in an advertising campaign for Jeremiah Weed Whiskey and appears on the soundtrack of the film Battleship.[32] The song itself is an interpretation of \"25 Lighters\" by Texan hip hop DJ DMD and rappers Lil\\' Keke and Fat Pat.[33] The first four songs from La Futura debuted on June 5, 2012, on an EP called Texicali.[34] DJ Screw was a major influence on the album as well, particularly because Gibbons and Screw both worked with engineer G. L. Moon during the late 1990s.[35]The band kicked off a North American tour with a concert in Red Bank, New Jersey, at the Count Basie Theatre on March 3, 2015. After rescheduled dates and additions, the tour wrapped up with a concert in Highland Park, Illinois, at the Ravinia Pavilion on August 27, with opening act Blackberry Smoke. Jeff Beck joined ZZ Top for seven concerts on the tour.[36][37]On September 9, 2016, ZZ Top released a new live album entitled Tonite at Midnight: Live Greatest Hits from Around the World.ZZ Top performed at the 2008 Orange Bowl game in Miami, as well as the Auto Club 500 NASCAR event at the Auto Club Speedway in Fontana, California. On June 23, 2008, ZZ Top celebrated the release of their first live concert DVD titled Live from Texas with the world premiere, a special appearance, and charity auction at the Hard Rock Cafe in Houston.[38] The DVD was officially released on June 24, 2008. The featured performance was culled from a concert filmed at the Nokia Theater in Grand Prairie, Texas, on November 1, 2007.On January 22, 2010, Billy Gibbons accompanied Will Ferrell and others playing \"Free Bird\" on Conan O\\'Brien\\'s last Tonight Show appearance. O\\'Brien joined in on guitar.[39]On June 8, 2011, a press release, reported on various media sources, announced that the new song \"Flyin\\' High\" will debut in space. Astronaut and friend of ZZ Top, Michael Fossum, was given the released single to listen to on his trip to the International Space Station.[40]On June 4, 2014, ZZ Top opened the CMT Awards performing \"La Grange\" with Luke Bryan and Florida Georgia Line.In addition to recording and performing concerts, ZZ Top has also been involved with films and television. In 1990, the group appeared as the \"band at the party\" in the film Back to the Future Part III,[41] and played the \"Three Men in a Tub\" in the movie Mother Goose Rock \\'n\\' Rhyme.[42] ZZ Top made further appearances, including the \"Gumby with a Pokey\" episode of Two and a Half Men in 2010[43] and the \"Hank Gets Dusted\" episode of King of the Hill in 2007.[44] The band was also guest hosts on an episode of WWE Raw.[45] Billy Gibbons also portrays the father of Angela Montenegro in the television show Bones.[46] Their song \"Sharp Dressed Man\" was one of the theme songs used for the television show Duck Dynasty, and on the series finale of the show they appeared with Si Robertson as a vocalist to perform the song on stage during Robertson\\'s retirement party.[47] Black Dahlia Films, led by Jamie Burton Chamberlin, of Seattle and Los Angeles, has contributed documentaries and back line screen work (the footage on back screens during live shows) and has become an integral part of the band\\'s film-making.[48][49]ZZ Top\\'s music videos won awards throughout the 1980s, winning once each in the categories Best Group Video, Best Direction, and Best Art Direction. The videos that won the VMAs are \"Legs\", \"Sharp Dressed Man\" and \"Rough Boy\".[50] Some of the high honors ZZ Top have achieved include induction into Hollywood\\'s RockWalk in 1994,[51] the Texas House of Representatives naming them \"Official Heroes for the State of Texas\",[52] a declaration of \"ZZ Top Day\" in Texas by then-governor Ann Richards on May 4, 1991,[53] and induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004. They were also given commemorative rings by actor Billy Bob Thornton from the VH1 Rock Honors in 2007.[25]ZZ Top also holds several chart and album sales feats, including six number-one singles on the Mainstream Rock chart. From the RIAA, ZZ Top has achieved four gold, three platinum and two multiple-platinum album certifications, in addition to one diamond album.[8] In addition to this, many of their songs have been in regular rotation on classic rock and hard rock radio stations.'}\n",
