Blind John Davis (December 7, 1913 â€“ October 12, 1985)[1] was an African-American blues, jazz and boogie-woogie pianist and singer.[2][3] He is best remembered for his recordings, including "A Little Every Day" and "Everybody's Boogie".[1]Davis was born in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, and relocated with his family to Chicago at the age of two.[4] Seven years later he had lost his sight. In his early years Davis backed Merline Johnson, and by his mid-twenties he was a well-known and reliable accompanying pianist. Between 1937 and 1942, he recorded with Big Bill Broonzy, Sonny Boy Williamson I, Tampa Red, Red Nelson,[5] Merline Johnson, and others. He also made several records of his own, singing in his lightweight voice.[2]Having played in various recording sessions with Lonnie Johnson, Davis teamed up with him in the 1940s.[6] He recorded later on his own. His "No Mail Today" (1949) was a minor hit.[2] Most of Doctor Clayton's later recordings featured Davis on piano.[7]He toured Europe with Broonzy in 1952, the first blues pianist to do so. In later years Davis toured and recorded frequently in Europe, where he enjoyed a higher profile than in the United States.[4]In 1955 Davis's house in Chicago burned down. His wife died in the fire, and his collection of 1700 78-rpm records, some of them unissued, was destroyed.[8]Davis died in Chicago in October 1985, at the age of 71.
