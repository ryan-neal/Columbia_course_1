Seeley also played piano with Art Tatum. Eubie Blake was also among Seeley's circle of friends.Seeley worked for a while as accompanist to Sippie Wallace. Seeley is an all-around pianist whose interest and repertoire span ragtime, stride, blues and boogie woogie.Seeley also has participated in the so-called "Cheek to Cheek Boogie" with Mark Braun AKA Mr. B.Peter Silvester wrote: "His solos are notable for their coherence and logical progression, which propels them to a satisfying climax. Of all the contemporary pianists, Seeley reproduces the sound and spirit of Meade Lux Lewis with the most conviction and sometimes even surpasses the master" (p.Â 247-248).
