The Jim Jones Revue was a UK garage rock and roll band composed of Jim Jones, Rupert Orton, Henri Herbert, Gavin Jay and Nick Jones.The band was formed after Jim Jones met Rupert Orton (the brother of folk singer Beth Orton) at his Not The Same Old Blues Crap club night in London.[1] In 2008, the band recorded their self-titled debut album in just 48 hours, in a rehearsal space in Camden Town, London.[1] The album was released on 8 September 2008 via Punk Rock Blues Records.A collection of singles and B-sides entitled Here To Save Your Soul was released on 5 October 2009.The band then recorded their second album, Burning Your House Down, which was produced by Jim Sclavunos of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds and Grinderman. In interview Jim Jones has explained that they also chose Sclavunos for his work with bands like Sonic Youth and The Cramps.[2] This second album was released on 16 August 2011 through Punk Rock Blues Records / PIAS Recordings.On 2 September 2010, the band previewed Burning Your House Down at London nightclub Madame Jojo's in front of a sold-out audience, which included Oasis singer Liam Gallagher as well as members of Grinderman and Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds.[3]They appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman (CBS-TV) on 7 September 2011.The band released their third album The Savage Heart on 12 October 2012 through Punk Rock Blues Records / PIAS Recordings.The band pianist, Henri Herbert, put on an impromptu performance on a public piano at St. Pancras International train station, London.
