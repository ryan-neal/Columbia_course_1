Vince Weber (born October 26, 1953, Hamburg) is a German blues and boogie-woogie pianist.Weber started taking piano lessons aged ten, in 1963. His sister introduced him to the blues by giving him records of Lightnin' Hopkins, Champion Jack Dupree, Taj Mahal and many others. At the age of sixteen he played in bars in the harbour of his hometown Hamburg, where he met Hans-Georg Möller, another pianist, who introduced him to the boogie-woogie style of playing piano. There he also met the comedian Otto Waalkes, who booked him as opener for his then-current tour. In 1975 he released his first album, The Boogie Man on Otto Waalkes' Rüssel Räckords, which was awarded 'Deutscher Schallplattenpreis 1976'. This album was partly recorded in the 'Fabrik', where he has had a regular gig once a month since 1976. In 1978 he traveled to the United States for the first time. In 1980 he became disc jockey at the local NDR radio station, where he hosted a weekly Blues broadcast.He has played with Big Joe Williams, Abi Wallenstein, Henry Heggen, Axel Zwingenberger, Jay McShann, James Booker, Chuck Berry and Champion Jack Dupree at music festivals and in clubs all over Germany.Due to illness, Vince Weber has reduced his stage activities in recent years.Weber has issued nine records.[1]1.
